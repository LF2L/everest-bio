ref_006,Microplastic footprints in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and their implications to the Yangtze River Basin,"Microplastics (MPs) are pervasive in the environment and have posed growing threat to ecosystems and human health. This study investigated MP abundances in surface water (fresh and salt lakes, urban and rural rivers, etc.) from 28 stations in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. MPs were detected in 25 out of 28 water samples with relatively low abundance (average 584.82 particles m−3). Fibers were the most frequently observed shape, particle sizes mostly ranged from 100 to 500 µm, and the greatest number of MPs was polypropylene. Source analysis identified the major sources of domestic wastewater and tourism in some areas. The concentration and proportion of small MPs (20–100 µm) in salty water were apparently greater than that in fresh water, indicating Salt intrusion accelerated MPs fragmentation. As the study area is the origin of the Yangtze River, we further compared the MP distribution throughout the watershed. Nearly two orders of magnitude in MP concentrations were increased associated with urban agglomeration in the middle and downstream areas, but the highest level was marked around the Yichang City (location of the Three Gorges Reservoir) due to interception associated with sedimentation and precipitation. This study provides data and theoretical bases for analyzing MPs migration and degradation processes in high altitudes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124776,Micro plastics literature?
ref_010,Bioeconomy moving forward step by step – A global journey,"Continuous, inspiring and interconnected step-by-step changes in thought and understanding, knowhow, actions and behaviour have often been instrumental in transitions from one particular age to the next in human history. This also applies to the present century and its sustainability challenges at the planetary, regional and local levels. Therefore, it is of great importance and relevance to move forward on the journey which has been started globally to address the not insignificant number of challenges. It is however essential to go beyond descriptive work by continuing with novel, inspiring and interconnected steps to find solutions to overcome these challenges. As this huge task also requires multidimensional communication, understanding and actions across different regions, cultures, disciplines and knowledge areas, the development of a common conceptual framework such as the concept of bioeconomy has been accepted globally as very valuable. The momentum which has been created in more than 50 countries around the world by the growing number of activities, initiatives and strategies in bioeconomy is very encouraging. This offers great opportunities to mobilize even more stakeholders in science and industry, as well as society, to join the bioeconomy journey. Strategic high-level concepts such as preserving the value of the natural capital of planet earth, connecting economy and ecology, sustaining the boundary conditions and habitability of our biosphere are highly important. It is also essential on the bioeconomy journey to connect with highly specific and actionable missions, programs and plans towards sustainable economic growth under the boundary conditions of our planet. © 2020",10.1016/j.nbt.2020.11.006,Bioeconomy literature
ref_012,Policy narratives of circular economy in the EU – Assessing the embeddedness of water and land in national action plans,"Following the challenges of the European Union (EU), member states have adopted circular economy (CE) plans and strategies, with objectives and measures to foster circularity. Although the concept of CE refers to various natural resources such as water and land, little is known on how current CE policies are integrating these environmental resources. This article assesses how water and land concerns are embedded in the EU CE action plans issued in 2015 and 2020 and a set of nine member states’ subsequent national plans. The assessment used a content analysis based on two variables, the frequency of water and land’ related terms and the consistency of their inclusion within the plans. The findings reveal that neither water nor land emerge as major concerns in the CE plans, in comparison to materials or waste. Also, they are not consistently associated with the typical components of the plans namely problem-showcase, objectives, strategies and measures, stakeholders, and CE performance indicators. Nevertheless, the embeddedness of water is more evident in the plans of southern countries, whereas land concerns are much more erratic. If water and land concerns, are to be at the forefront of the transition to circularity, as the literature recommends, and if these plans are expected to offer an integrated approach of the CE concept, further efforts should be made to ensure their embeddedness. © 2020",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125685,Narratives in the circular economy
ref_014,Development of an integrated sustainability matrix to depict challenges and trade-offs of introducing bio-based plastics in the food packaging value chain,"As global plastic pollution is gaining increased attention, the use of bio-based plastics, especially in the food packaging sector, is growing in popularity. While this move is regarded as a solution to plastic pollution, it may shift or create detrimental impacts elsewhere in the production, consumption, management system, a possibility that is underexplored. The aim of the present study is to identify the potential challenges and trade-offs associated with the introduction of bio-based plastics in the food packaging industry, and highlight issues relevant to policy and decision-making processes. We employ a whole system approach to review the literature and assess holistically the performance of bio-based plastics, which looks at the entire lifecycle of bio-based plastic packaging (i.e. production, consumption, management) and considers wider aspects in the environmental, economic, social and technical sustainability domains. Based on our findings, we developed, and present herein, a sustainability decision matrix, a novel guiding tool, which can provide important insights into the potential impacts of the introduction of larger amount of bio-based plastic food packaging in the future and support decision-making processes. In conclusion, our preliminary high-level assessment of the bio-based plastics production, use and management system clearly reveals a number of blind-spots across the entire system that are currently ignored by the use of single-dimensional approaches. This highlights that the sustainability assessment of specific bio-based polymers requires thorough and further research that takes into account the type of feedstock, infrastructure availability, and interactions between sustainability domains, to ensure that the substitution of petrochemical-based plastics with bio-based alternatives in food packaging sector will not lead to unintended consequences. © 2020",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125378,bioplastics
ref_015,The occurrence and transport of microplastics: The state of the science,"Microplastic (MP) particles have been observed in most environments and concentrations are expected to increase over the coming decades given continued and increased production of synthetic polymer products. The expected increase in plastic pollution (including MPs) may elevate the risk posed by these synthetic particles to both environmental and human health. The purpose of this review is to provide a review of the state of knowledge regarding the occurrence and transport of MPs in and across three of the Earths subsystems, specifically, the lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. Evidence is presented that shows the lithosphere includes substantial MP accumulation (e.g. approximately 25 particles L−1 in landfill leachate), the impacts of which remain poorly understood. The atmosphere plays an important role in MP transport, with increased occurrence and higher transport concentrations noted in more densely populated areas (e.g. 175 to 313 particles m−2 d−1 in Dongguan China). In the hydrosphere, freshwater ecosystems alternate between MP transport (e.g. rivers) and deposition (e.g. lakes) with flow rate being identified as a key factor determining the movement and fate of MPs. Conversely, marine ecosystems act as a major sink for MP pollution (e.g. MP comprise 94%, approximately 1.69 trillion pieces, of plastic pieces in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch), driven by direct deposition or by transport via the atmosphere or freshwater conveyance systems (e.g. streams, rivers, or ice sheets). Once ingested by organisms, the trophic transfer and bioaccumulation of MPs has been confirmed with the polymer particles potentially accumulating in or impacting fauna, flora, microbes, and humans. Finally, 16 areas are identified in which future MP research efforts should be focused, with the goal of accurately identifying the scope and potential risks posed by synthetic polymer pollution. This review serves as a valuable steppingstone for future research and researchers wishing to address MP research gaps across various environmental settings in the coming decades. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143936,NA
ref_017,From source to sink: Review and prospects of microplastics in wetland ecosystems,"The source, distribution, migration, and fate of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems have received much attention. However, the relevant reports in wetland ecosystems, the boundary area between water and land, are still rare. Where are the sources and sinks of MPs in the wetland? The latest researches have shown that the sources of MPs in wetlands include sewage discharge, surface runoff, and plastic wastes from aquaculture. Fibers and fragments are the most common shapes, and PE, PP, PS can be detected in water or sediment matrices, and biota of wetlands. The distribution is affected by hydrodynamic conditions, sediment properties, and vegetation coverage. Factors affecting the vertical migration of MPs include their own physical and chemical properties, the combination of substances that accelerate deposition (mineral adsorption and biological flocculation), and resuspension. Minerals tend to adsorb negatively charged MPs while algae aggregates have a preference for positively charged MPs. The wetlands vegetation can trap MPs and affect their migration. In water matrices, MPs are ingested by organisms and integrated into sediments, which makes them seem undetectable in the wetland ecosystem. Photodegradation and microbial degradation can further reduce the MPs in size. Although recent research has increased, we are still searching for a methodological harmonization of the detection practices and exploring the migration rules and fate patterns of MPs. Our work is the first comprehensive review of the source, distribution, migration, and fate of MPs in wetland ecosystems. It reveals the uniqueness of wetland habitat in the research of MPs and indicates the potential of wetlands acting as sources or sinks for MPs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143633,NAMicroplastics
ref_019,The interoperability of exergy and Life Cycle Thinking in assessing manufacturing sustainability: A review of hybrid approaches,"Today, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the most employed tool for assessing the sustainability of products and processes, both from an environmental, social and economic point of view. Exergy is defined by literature as the amount of useful work that can be derived from a real system when it is brought into equilibrium with its environment. In the literature, it is considered an outstanding concept that can be applied to enhance the effectiveness of ordinary evaluation models such as LCA. The literature proposes a variety of hybrid approaches that combine Exergetic Analysis (EA) and LCA with different combination frameworks. The aim of this paper is to describe the potential of each hybrid method and to characterize the degree of interoperability between EA and LCA that each of them can provide. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks that seem to be too challenging to overcome: a variety of inconsistencies in the interpretation of the results due to the difficulty of the inventory phase and the ambiguity in the choice of the correct alternative in the standard databases; the link with old techniques that refers to obsolete approaches in finding data that suit to the updated goals and scopes; the difficulty in conducting an assessment affected by the least possible uncertainty. Following a theoretical overview of the principles of each hybrid method that binds EA and LCA, the authors want to provide a review from a completely different point of view than the state-of-the-art literature, on how effectively EA and LCA can interact with each other in order to provide a more holistic view of the system/process to be assessed. The fascinating circumstance that emerges from the review is that any exergy approach would be more effective if joined (not replaced) to the standard LCA, because it turned out to be complementary. This theory has long been developed by many authors in their case studies as a confirmation of what Gutowski wrote years ago: no single alternative criteria or subsidiary model, independently of how well aggregated, may offer a suitable answer for all conditions. Specifically, through this review, the practitioners would be able to choose the best suited hybrid methodology, according to their aims, join the outcomes together and achieve a transdisciplinary knowledge of the behavior of the study case system, in order to design the best improvement strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124932,LCA and exergy?
ref_020,Environmental soil quality and vegetable safety under current greenhouse vegetable production management in China,"Rapid expansion of greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) in China over the last few decades has substantially promoted vegetable production and farmers’ incomes. However, the semi-closed GVP environment can lead to accumulation of soil contaminants and impose a threat to human health through consumption of vegetables. This paper reviews the current environmental soil status and vegetable safety in Chinese GVPs. Furthermore, we propose several lines of future research to better understand the sources and pathways of GVP contaminants and to identify alternative management to achieve sustainable development. Our review suggests that legacy agricultural practices, including intensive application of agrochemicals and frequent irrigation, have led to significant soil acidification and salinization, as well as accumulation of nutrients and emerging contaminants in human-altered and human-transported soils used for GVP and in GVP vegetables. Over fertilization has led to very low nutrient use efficiencies, particularly for phosphorus and nitrogen. In addition, high inputs of manure, plastic films, and pesticides have promoted significant accumulation of organochlorines, antibiotics, phthalic acid esters, and heavy metals in soils and vegetables at levels exceeding or close to their permitted environmental threshold values. Leafy vegetables with large surface area have the highest levels of contaminants which, in turn, can cause health risks to consumers. Nevertheless, the sources and the paths of contaminants entering the soils and vegetables have not been widely investigated, particularly in the southwestern and northern Chinese provinces. Future research should include detailed documentation of agrochemicals and soil properties involved in the retention, degradation, and mobilization of contaminants. Furthermore, new cleaning technologies should be taken in practice to mitigate or prevent contamination of soil and vegetables. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.agee.2020.107230,Possible example for ecosystem services and plastic?
ref_022,A probabilistic risk assessment of microplastics in soil ecosystems,"Plastics have a variety of applications due to their versatility, relative cost, and strength-to-weight ratio, and resistance to degradation. As a result, plastic waste can be found in all corners of the Earth. A class of plastic contaminants that have received increasing attention in terms of their potential impact on ecosystems is microplastics (≤5 mm). The greatest attention to date has been on their potential effect in marine ecosystems. However, a growing number of studies are examining their potential impact on soil ecosystems. The data reported in the literature on the environmentally-relevant concentrations of microplastics in soils and the concentration of microplastics that causes an adverse effect in soil biota were used to perform a probabilistic risk assessment of microplastics to soil biota. An environmental exposure distribution was constructed from the concentrations of microplastics reported in soil in the literature. Species sensitivity distributions were constructed using concentration of microplastics in soil that had no adverse effect on soil species (NOEC) or the lowest concentrations that had an adverse effect on soil species (LOEC) reported in the literature. The 95th centile of the environmental exposure distribution (8147 microplastic particles per gram of soil) was greater than 22 and 28% of the species sensitivity distribution constructed using NOECs and LOECs, respectively. The assessment concluded that environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics reported in the literature could pose a considerable risk to soil biota. It is also important to note that due to the continued production of large quantities of plastic and the persistence of microplastics in the environment, environmentally-relevant concentrations of microplastics in soil are likely to only rise. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143987,microplastics soil assessment
ref_023,Circular economy and paradox theory: A business model perspective,"Business models have become the subject of increasing attention amid management practitioners and researchers since the early nineties and business model innovation has emerged as a distinctive field of academic enquiry. More recently, business model innovation for the circular economy has caught the attention of business leaders and academics alike as the circular economy promises to deliver economic prosperity within ecological limits. Yet research on circular business models is nascent and the business literature gives limited attention to the challenges deriving from circular economy implementation. Using an integrative research approach and particularly, drawing on both paradox theory and circular economy principles and loops, this article provides a preliminary, conceptual systematisation of the typology of organisational tensions in circular economy implementation. It also discusses the relevance of these tensions from a business model perspective. As a result, this article contributes to circular economy research wherein challenges are mostly analysed at the macro level and in the absence of a specific theoretical anchoring. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124823,NA
ref_024,Mangroves as unique but understudied traps for anthropogenic marine debris: A review of present information and the way forward,"Marine debris and plastic pollution affect all coastal habitats, however coastal debris studies are predominantly performed on sandy beaches. Other coastal habitats, such as mangroves, remain understudied. Eighteen of the top twenty rivers that contribute the most plastic to the ocean are associated with mangroves, but very few of those forests were investigated in terms of plastic debris pollution. Here we discuss the results of the few available studies on macrodebris conducted in mangroves, which show that mangrove debris research is still in its early stages, with many areas of study to be further investigated. Indeed, the distinct structural complexity of mangroves increases their ability to trap debris from both terrestrial, freshwater and marine sources, resulting in impacts unique to the mangrove ecosystem. Our review highlights a significant lack in standardisation across the performed surveys. Here we suggest standardised guidelines for future integrated macrodebris and microplastic studies in mangroves to facilitate comparisons between studies. Such standardisation should prioritize the use of stratified random sampling, the measurement of the area covered by the debris and the abundance and type of macrodebris and microplastics found, in order to assess the ecological impact of macrodebris and its role as source of microplastics for adjacent ecosystems. We also advocate the use of standard categories across studies, based on those identified for surveying other coastal habitats. This review highlights an alarming knowledge gap in extent, sources and overall impacts of marine macrodebris, mainly constituted by plastic, on mangrove forests, which hinders policy making to address this issue. Standardised, reliable and extended research on this aspect of mangrove pollution is needed to manage and protect these endangered vegetated coastal ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.envpol.2020.116291,Plasticos in Oceanos marino
ref_025,Plastic ingestion and dispersion by vultures may produce plastic islands in natural areas,"Rubbish dumps can become an important environmental source of plastic. Several species feed on organic waste from these sites, but at the same time are exposed to non-organic materials. Species that can gather food in these sites might at the same time disperse waste consumed, but this has rarely been evaluated. We compare the occurrence of plastic debris in regurgitated pellets of three sympatric vultures from northwest Patagonia, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), black vultures (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), foraging in different degrees of humanized sites. We also evaluate the influence of rubbish dumps in the presence of plastic debris in pellets of the studied species and their potential role in spreading plastic to the environment. Most synthetic material present in pellets was plastic. Pellets of Andean condors, which avoid disturbed anthropic sites in this area, showed almost no plastic debris compared with the other sympatric vulture species, suggesting an influence of the foraging habits on plastic ingestion. For black and turkey vultures, we found that rubbish dumps may be an important source of plastic. The occurrence of plastic debris in pellets of black vultures sampled in 2010 and 2020 increased, probably associated with the increase in urbanization and waste production in the study area. Avian scavengers were exposed to and are able to transport plastic to distant communal roosts generating “plastic islands”. It is necessary to reduce plastic generation and better waste management practices to avoid species and environments to be affected by this pollutant. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142421,Plastic Ingestion?
ref_026,Cleaner production practices at company level enhance the desire of employees to have a significant positive impact on society through work,"Implementation of cleaner production practices (CPP), service quality (SQ) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) is often studied at organizational level. A number of studies on trio have reported it's significant impact on overall organizational performance and profitability across the globe. However, not much is studied about the individual level micro influence of these constructs on employee engagement (EE), organizational pride (OP), organizational identification (OI) and “desire to have a significant impact through work” (DSIW). Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR on EE, OP, OI and DSIW. Data collected from 320 non-managerial staff members employed at a garments manufacturing company in Pakistan was analyzed using partial least square (PLS) approach. Findings revealed that the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR plays an important role in shaping EE, OP, OI and DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry. Further, it is found that the implementation of CPP has a non-significant impact on SQ. Additionally, results of the importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) have also confirmed that the implementation of CPP at company level has shown a highest importance and performance amongst all the latent constructs proposed as predictors of DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry. These findings are a step forward and unique contribution of this study in the domain of CPP, SQ, CSR, EE, OP, OI and DSIW. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124605,Sustainable behaviours
ref_027,Overview of global status of plastic presence in marine vertebrates,"The presence of plastic in the environment is generating impacts on all habitats and has become a major global problem in marine megafauna. Macroplastics can cause entanglement, ingestion and loss of suitable habitats. In addition to entanglement problems, there is evidence that plastics are entering the food web through ingestion by marine organisms, which could ultimately be affecting humans. Much of the available information on the impact of plastic in biota is scattered and disconnected due to the use of different methodologies. Here, we review the variety of approaches and protocols followed to assess macro- and microplastic ingestion in marine vertebrates such as sea turtles, cetaceans and fishes in order to offer a global overview of their current status. The analysis of 112 studies indicates the highest plastic ingestion in organisms collected in the Mediterranean and Northeast Indian Ocean with significant differences among plastic types ingested by different groups of animals, including differences in colour and the type of prevalent polymers. In sea turtles, the most prevalent types of plastics are white plastics (66.60%), fibres (54.54%) and LDPE polymer (39.09%); in cetaceans, white macro- and microplastics (38.31%), fibres (79.95%) and PA polymer (49.60%); and in fishes, transparent plastics (45.97%), fibres (66.71%) and polyester polymer (36.20%). Overall, clear fibre microplastics are likely the most predominant types ingested by marine megafauna around the globe. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/gcb.15416,Plastic in marine vertebrates
ref_035,Advancing circular economy performance indicators and their application in Spanish companies,"Current research on the circular economy (CE) reveals that, while the concept and its application have been extensively explored as shown in several case studies, the definition of tools and criteria measuring “circularity” of products, companies or regions are not well-defined. Therefore, indicators for measuring the different levels of a CE (micro, meso, and macro) should be a high priority for stakeholders (governments, companies, NGOs, civil society, etc.) in order to track progress on CE initiatives. However, the increasing interest on CE has caused a still open debate on the conceptualization of CE which hampers the creation of indicators based on a common conceptual framework. As a result, the absence of standard indicators to track progress on circularity is leading to contradiction and misunderstanding, which represents a challenge to the implementation of CE strategies. Thus, this study tries to address this gap by advancing a set of indicators adapted from existing indicators that guarantees simplicity and effectiveness, closely based on indicators proposed by government bodies. This research carried out an exploratory study to formulate the indicators requirements based on literature, refined through experts’ opinion and then they were tested in Spanish companies located in the Basque Country region through an empirical work to assess this theory. A mix of research methods (e.g. semi-structured interviews and surveys) were used to seek applicability of CE indicators for organisations. The study showed that the proposed indicators currently used for assessing the CE at the macro level were applicable at the micro level based on companies’ responses. This fact demonstrated that the indicators serve the purpose of being applicable to companies regardless of the type of economic activity they were in. Also, it shows that indicators used to monitor progress on CE at the macro level can be translated to the micro level. Consequently, it is recommended that the set of CE indicators focused on the methodology proposed in this study should be used across different industrial sectors in order to observe performance in companies to facilitate the transition to a CE model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123605,NA

ref_039,Alien wood species as a resource for wood-plastic composites,"Since invasive alien species are one of the main causes of biodiversity loss in the region and thus of changes in ecosystem services, it is important to find the best possible solution for their removal from nature and the best practice for their usability. The aim of the study was to investigate their properties as components of wood-plastic composites and to investigate the properties of the wood-plastic composites produced. The overall objective was to test the potential of available alien plant species as raw material for the manufacture of products. This would contribute to sustainability and give them a better chance of ending their life cycle. One of the possible solutions on a large scale is to use alien wood species for the production of wood plastic composites (WPC). Five invasive alien hardwood species have been used in combination with polyethylene powder (PE) and maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (MAPE) to produce various flat pressed WPC boards. Microstructural analyses (confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) and mechanical tests (flexural strength, tensile strength) were performed. Furthermore, measurements of density, thickness swelling, water absorption and dimensional stability during heating and cooling were carried out. Comparisons were made between the properties of six WPC boards (five alien wood species and mixed boards). The results showed that the differences between different invasive alien wood species were less obvious in mechanical properties, while the differences in sorption properties and dimensional stability were more significant. The analyses of the WPC structure showed a good penetration of the polymer into the lumens of the wood cells and a fine internal structure without voids. These are crucial conditions to obtain a good, mechanically strong and water-resistant material. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",10.3390/app11010044,"Maybe.

ref_040,Plastics recycling with tracer-based-sorting: Challenges of a potential radical technology,"To improve the recycling quality of plastics packaging and achieve high recycling rates new identification and sorting technologies are required. Tracer-based-sorting (TBS) is an innovative identification technology based on fluorescent tracers and a corresponding detection unit. TBS can be considered a radical technology change towards a circular economy for plastics and to support sustainability as it has the potential to render several established sorting and/or recycling steps obsolete. This article shows which drivers and barriers are perceived by stakeholders with regard to the implementation of TBS in the market and how challenges are addressed responsibly in the early phases of the innovation process. Influencing external factors and framework conditions of TBS are identified and suitable business models for TBS in a circular economy are discussed. Further, practical recommendations on how to optimize technology and market development for TBS are provided. To obtain these results a mixed method approach of integrated innovation and sustainability analysis, external environment analysis (PESTEL analysis), and business model development approaches was chosen. The research results can be understood as a practical contribution towards a responsible and sustainable implementation of a radical technology-based innovation for a circular economy of plastics. © 2020 by the authors.

ref_041,Review of plastic pollution policies of Arctic countries in relation to seabirds,"Marine plastic is a ubiquitous environmental problem that can have an impact on a variety of marine biota, such as seabirds, making it an important concern for scientists and policy makers. Although research on plastic ingestion by seabirds is increasing, few studies have examined policies and long-term monitoring programs to reduce marine plastic in the Arctic. This paper provides a review of international, national, and regional policies and long-term monitoring programs that address marine plastic in relation to seabirds in the Arctic countries: Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark (Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United States of America. Results show that a broad range of international, national, regional and local policies address marine debris, specifically through waste management and the prevention of pollution from ships. However, few policies directly address seabirds and other marine biota. Further, policies are implemented inconsistently across regions, making it difficult to enforce and monitor the efficacy of these policies given the long-range transport of plastic pollution globally. To reduce marine plastic pollution in the Arctic environment, pan-Arctic and international collaboration is needed to implement standardized policies and long-term monitoring programs for marine plastic in the Arctic and worldwide.

ref_046,A participatory methodology for characterizing and prescribing water-energy-food nexus based on improved casual loop diagrams,"As the basis of quantitative research over water-energy-food nexus (WEFN), qualitative analysis is indispensable for depicting the systems and providing effective measures and policies. Preceding qualitative WEFN studies largely neglected the role of local stakeholder participation, which could only reflect fragments of the systems. Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) have been proven to be effective for supporting stakeholder participation in many other areas. Nevertheless, there was a lack of impartial methods that could make CLD analysis tractable without significantly impairing the WEFN systems integrity. To fill such gaps, a novel method based on merging and reduction rules was proposed to reasonably merge and downscale WEFN CLDs built by stakeholders. Based on this improved method, a CLD-based methodology was developed as a prototype for characterizing WEFN systems, prescribing the WEFN problem, exploring its causes and consequences, and identifying effective measures and policies for alleviating conflicts. To validate the applicability of the developed methodology, it was applied to a real case. The results indicated that total water consumption, water allocation among varied sectors, available surface water, and available groundwater, as well as indirect factors such as volume of diverted water and agricultural water consumption, were the keys to alleviate water scarcity problem under WEFN in the study area. Measures and polices focusing on the interactions between surface water and groundwater could be viable for alleviating the problem. Directions to enhance tradeoffs and synergies within WEFN systems were also obtained. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105124,NA
ref_047,The role of urban manufacturing for a circular economy in cities,"In recent years, implementing a circular economy in cities (or “circular cities”) has been proposed by policy makers as a potential solution for achieving sustainability. One strategy for circular cities is to reintroduce manufacturing into urban areas (or “urban manufacturing”), allowing resource flows to be localized at the city scale. However, the extent to which urban manufacturing contributes to circular cities is unclear in existing literature. The purpose of this paper is therefore twofold: to understand whether urban manufacturing could contribute to the circular economy, and to understand the drivers and barriers to circular urban manufacturing. By reviewing existing literature and interviewing experts, we identified the caveats for the contribution of urban manufacturing to circular cities, as well as the spatial, social, and material-related drivers and barriers for circular urban manufacturing. © 2020 by the authors.

The programs’ most important methodologies are assigned to the sectors forestry, renewable energy, energy efficiency, industrial gas, and waste. We analyzed each sector for its compatibility with LCA using a criteria evaluation scheme to answer the main question, whether the methodologies provide guidance on life cycle emission accounting and what uncertainties they face. The offsetting standards differ from LCA standards due to different analyzed systems, system boundaries and purposes of their methods. Furthermore, offsetting methods always apply scenario analysis. Environmental impacts apart from greenhouse gases are not quantified, rather environmental impact assessments of heterogeneous quality are applied. We find that the approaches in the analyzed carbon offsets are incompatible with the LCA approach, mainly because they always involve scenario analysis, do not include all life-cycle phases and do not account for additional (negative) environmental and social impacts that project activities related to carbon offsets may cause. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-50519-6_14,Carbon indicators literature
ref_052,Sustainability check for bio-based technologies: A review of process-based and life cycle approaches,"Industries across the world are making a transition from fossil resources to renewable biological feedstock for the production of chemicals, fuels, and materials, as a strategy to promote sustainable development and economic growth. However, limited biomass availability can halt the expansion of bio-based sectors, unless alternative raw materials are employed and cascading uses are implemented on a large scale. Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) can contribute to feedstock diversification and improved biomass conversion efficiencies along supply chains, although concerns arise about their actual viability and competitiveness. A systematic review of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and related process-based approaches is carried out to evaluate the sustainability of advanced bio-based technologies, defined as those that use either non-food feedstock or circularity principles –or both– for delivering diverse products. A classification scheme is proposed to categorise KETs based on the feedstock employed (plant residues and perennials, designer crops, algae, or biological waste) or the underlying technological configuration (enzyme/microbial assisted processing or biorefineries). Results show that producing biofuels and biochemicals from perennial plants, lignocellulosic residues and algae has advantages in terms of greenhouse gas emissions relative to their fossil counterparts, while trade-offs occur with other environmental impacts and sustainability dimensions. Cradle-to-cradle systems can deliver additional sustainability gains, but their implementation poses technical and socio-political challenges. Further harmonisation of LCA methodologies is desirable to compare KETs in different sectoral, geographical and policy contexts. In spite of the diversity of outcomes and approaches, this review provides an overview of advanced bio-based technologies, while shedding light on the often overestimated sustainability benefits of the bioeconomy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.rser.2020.110213,bioeconomy literature
ref_056,"Environment and COVID-19: Pollutants, impacts, dissemination, management and recommendations for facing future epidemic threats","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Its relationship with environmental factors is an issue that has attracted the attention of scientists and governments. This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of “one health” approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in future epidemic threats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141314,NA
ref_058,Analysis of the circular economic production models and their approach in agriculture and agricultural waste biomass management,"As of now, circular economic production models of the circular economy (CEPMs), which include circular economy, bioeconomy, and circular bioeconomy, are among the main tools characterizing development policies in different countries. During the last five years, policies and strategies regarding CEPMs have promoted and contributed to the development of research on this topic. The evolution and most relevant aspects of the three CEPMs previously mentioned have been analyzed from a sample of 2190 scientific publications obtained from the Scopus database. Bibliometric analysis has been used to evaluate the approach of these models in agriculture and to introduce the ways in which they address the management of agricultural waste biomass (AWB). Results show that the circular economy is the most studied and prioritized model in China and most European countries, with the UK leading the way. Germany leads in topics related to the bioeconomy. The management policies and strategies of the circular bioeconomy are key to promoting research focused on AWB valorization since bioenergy and/or biofuel production continue to be a priority. © 2020 by the authors.

ref_059,Microplastics could be a threat to plants in terrestrial systems directly or indirectly,"Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging threat to ecosystem functioning and biota. The major sources of MPs are terrestrial and agricultural lands. But their fate, concentration in the terrestrial environment, and effects on soil and biota are poorly understood. There is a growing body of concern about the adverse effects of MPs on soil-dwelling organisms such as microbes in mycorrhizae and earthworms that mediate essential ecosystem services. Environmental concentrations and effects of MPs are considered to increase with increasing trend of its global production. MPs in the soil could directly impact plants through blocking the seed pore, limiting the uptake of water and nutrient through roots, aggregation, and accumulation in the root, shoot, and leaves. However, MPs can also indirectly impact plants by affecting soil physicochemical characteristics, soil-dwelling microbes, and fauna. An affected soil could impact plant community structure and perhaps primary production. In this article, we have assessed the potential direct and indirect impacts of MPs on plants. We have discussed both the positive and negative impacts of MPs on plants in terrestrial systems based on currently available limited literature on this topic and our hypothetical understandings. We have summarized the most current progress in this regard highlighting the future directions on microplastic research in terrestrial systems. © 2020 Elsevier LtdMicroplastics could impact plants directly through uptake from the soil or indirectly by modifying soil structure or growth patterns of soil-dwelling organisms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115653,MIcroplastics literature
ref_060,Pros and cons of plastic during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Since the beginning of the first cases of the new coronavirus, opinions and laws on the use of plastic materials have been questioned around the world. Their importance in the manufacture of hospital devices and personal protective equipment (PPE) is unquestionable, as they contribute largely to the reduction of the virus spread, helping health systems from all edges of the world and, most importantly, saving lives. However, the same material that is a protector, becomes a polluter when inadequately disposed of in the environment, generating or worsening socio-environmental problems, such as pollution of water bodies by plastic. A critical overview of the role of plastic during the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in this paper. A future panorama is attempted to be outlined. The real possibility of the virus spread from the use of plastic is discussed, as well as the recycling of plastic during the pandemic, correlating its use with problems that it may cause. © 2020 by the author.

ref_062,A Socio-economic Indicator for EoL Strategies for Bio-based Products,"In recent years, the bioeconomy has received increased attention from policy makers and practitioners, leading to a first switch from fossil to bio-based products. To open up new market opportunities, transparent information on the sustainability of bio-based products must be provided, taking into account all life cycle stages. The determination of suitable end of life (EoL) strategies furthers this aim. Notably, the socio-economic aspects of EoL alternatives associated with bio-based products have been neglected. This paper contributes to filling this gap by proposing a new socio-economic indicator for EoL (SEI-EoL). The SEI-EoL is developed from an integrated analytic hierarchy process–multicriteria decision analysis (AHP-MCDA) model based on experts' involvement, and is capable of measuring and comparing the socio-economic performance of EoL alternatives for bio-based products. The SEI-EoL is applied to the specific case of polylactic acid (PLA)–based film for food packaging. The results indicate that value chain actors are the most influential category of stakeholders in EoL management, and the assessment of criteria shows that waste disposal cost, resource efficiency and EoL responsibility play a key role in this management. The highest value EoL strategy for PLA-based film for food packaging is mechanical recycling, followed by chemical recycling. Circularity assessment, policy maker responsibility and incentives for recycled materials/green processes represent the most relevant items to consider for policy recommendations and actions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106794,PLA Packaging?
ref_064,Bioeconomy imaginaries: A review of forest-related social science literature,"This review article examines how social science literature co-produces various imaginaries of forest-based bioeconomy transformations and pathways for reaching desired ends. Based on an analysis of 59 research articles, we find that despite a growing number of social sciences studies on the forest-based bioeconomy, much of the research tends to replicate a bioeconomy imaginary articulated in EU and national bioeconomy policies and strategies. Accordingly, the research primarily reproduces a weak approach to sustainability, which prioritize economic growth and competitiveness. Expectations are largely directed at national and regional corporate interests and forest industrial renewal, while the state has a supportive rather than restricting role. We discuss the findings against the role of social sciences, and conclude that social science scholars may adopt various strategies if interested in opening up forest-based policy debates and offer alternative imaginaries of sustainable bioeconomy transformations. © 2020, The Author(s).",10.1007/s13280-020-01398-6,Critics on Circular economy
ref_066,Message framing strategies for effective marine conservation communication,"1.Human activities are a major source of threat to marine ecosystems. Solutions thus require changes to or cessation of those activities in addition to multiple restorative and conservation efforts – all of which, in turn, require public support for success. However, scientific understanding of threats to marine ecosystems has not paralleled public understanding of those threats in many jurisdictions. Highly complex, interwoven, distant, vulnerable to multiple stressors, and hosting biota that are biologically unfamiliar to people, marine ecosystems present unique communication challenges. 2.The merits of effective communication capable of motivating behavioural change, policy action and support for marine conservation are often emphasized. To date, however, environmental communication, as a field, has largely focused on terrestrial ecosystems and more recently on climate change, leaving research-informed marine conservation communication neglected. 3.Adding to the small compilation of marine conservation communication literature, this integrative review provides a new understanding of how six message frames (emotional, problem/solution, outcome, value-based, distance, and social norm) can interactively help enhance the effectuality of conservation messages. Insights from the framing-related literature are merged with those from relevant fields including the theoretical literature, and the behavioural, social, and environmental sciences to define concepts, provide examples and explain the relevance of the six identified frames. The potential strength of these frames are discussed and suggestions on how they might be used to communicate different marine conservation issues are provided. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/aqc.3349,"Maybe

ref_067,Basic principles for development and implementation of plastic clean-up technologies: What can we learn from fisheries management?,"Plastic pollution compromises ocean health, with large amounts of plastics continuing to enter marine and coastal environments. Various mitigative engineering solutions are being developed and implemented in response to this threat. While recognising the positive impacts of clean-ups, we highlight two perspectives given little attention to date, which are vital to evaluating the cost-benefit ratio of clean-ups: firstly, clean-up efficiency where density and accessibility of litter are key, and secondly, potential negative externalities that implementation of clean-up technologies may have. These principles, catch per unit effort and the impact on non-target species, are well known from fisheries management. We argue they should also be applied in evaluating marine litter removal schemes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141117,Plastic and marine impacts?
ref_070,"Environmental knowledge, risk attitude, and households' willingness to accept compensation for the application of degradable agricultural mulch film: Evidence from rural China","The promotion and use of degradable agricultural mulch film are satisfactory means to realize the pollution control of agricultural mulch film. Today, when the cost of degradable agricultural mulch film is much higher than that of ordinary agricultural mulch film, appropriate policy tools must be identified. However, relevant research is relatively rare. This paper attempts to understand the acceptability of households of policy tools by investigating households' willingness to apply degradable agricultural mulch film to reduce agricultural mulch film pollution and their requirements for compensation proportion, to make this sector cleaner and pay more attention to the implementation of sustainability principles. The sample is five cities in Hubei province, China; the study is based on extended planned behavior (TPB) theory; and we use the double-hurdle model to analyze “whether to accept compensation” and “proportion of compensation” of households. The main results show that the more households know about policies, the higher the proportion of compensation required. However, households with high knowledge of ecological value are willing to adopt degradable agricultural mulch films even if the government provides less compensation. In addition, risk-biased households are willing to voluntarily bear more additional costs of degradable agricultural mulch films. The results obtained have multiple meanings. First, in today's rural areas of China, compared with the formal government regulations, informal regulations are the key factors to promote degradable agricultural mulch films application. Second, the enhancement of the understanding of the knowledge of ecological value can effectively improve households' consciousness of using degradable agricultural mulch film. Third, to realize the sustainability of policies, households' risk attitude must be strengthened. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140616,Extended Theory of Planned Behaviour in Acceptance of the change of plastic films
ref_075,"The impact of tourism on marine litter pollution on Santa Marta beaches, Colombian Caribbean","Tourism is an important socioeconomic activity in coastal communities, which deteriorates marine-coastal ecosystem quality when poorly managed, increasing litter pollution on beaches during the main tourist seasons. This study aims to assess the tourism impact on litter pollution on eleven Santa Marta beaches, Colombian Caribbean. During high and low tourist seasons, people on the beaches were counted, macrolitter and microplastics were sampled, and perception surveys about litter on beaches were conducted. During the high tourist season, the number of people and macrolitter pollution increased, compared to the low tourist season. Plastics accounted for 30%–77% of macrolitter and microplastics ranged from 1 to 355 items/m2. Respondents identified tourism as a main litter source and plastics as the most common litter type. All assessed beaches are impacted by tourism causing litter pollution, therefore, stronger controls, educational, and awareness strategies are needed to reduce litter pollution and prevent ecological and socioeconomic impacts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111558,Plasticos marinos en COlombia
ref_076,The impacts of polyethylene terephthalate microplastics (mPETs) on ecosystem functionality in marine sediment,"The effects of microplastics (MPs) on the ecological functioning in marine sediments is largely unknown. However, coastal marine sediments and their resident communities play critical roles in the transformation of organic matter and the cycling of nutrients that influence both local and global processes. To investigate how microplastics influence ecosystem functions associated with sediment biogeochemistry, large bivalves and microphytobenthos, we conducted a 31-day laboratory experiment. The experiment tested the role of micro-polyethylene terephthalate (mPETs) at five concentrations (0%, 1%, 3%, 6%, and 8% based on wet weight of top 1 cm sediment). Canonical principle of coordinate analysis (CAP) was applied to assess change on the ecosystem functionality with increasing concentrations of mPETs.

ref_078,Reviewing environmental life cycle impacts of biobased polymers: current trends and methodological challenges,"Purpose: The aim of this review is to evaluate previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of first- and second-generation bioplastics, to understand the state of the art and the main problems addressed during the development of new bioplastics. Furthermore, it provides an overview on land use change (LUC) impacts accounted for, methodologies chosen, and the results obtained. Methods: Studies related to the impact assessment of bioplastics and published between 2007 and 2018 were gathered. Five keyword strings were used to perform a wide search and select relevant LCA studies. The study aimed to analyze critical methodological aspects in LCA, in order to determine the most common choices made during biobased material analyses, as well as major limitations. Three filters were applied to select comparable studies, ending with a final number of 17 papers. Recommendations were obtained by comparing common practices performed by different authors with suggested best available practices mentioned in handbooks and guidelines. Interestingly, LUC metrics and impacts were, most of the time, neglected. Thus, a specific assessment and discussion was performed regarding the methods used to quantify LUC impacts, considering its importance during the production of biobased materials. Results and discussion: The study discussed the main environmental problems linked to the development of new biomaterials. LCA of agricultural products or systems, when compared with fossil-based counterparts, is expected to show higher environmental impacts in categories directly affected by fertilizer use, occupied and transformed land, among others. Thus, studies that included additional impact categories besides global warming (e.g., eutrophication or acidification) concluded that biobased materials present higher impacts, recommending improvements in farming practices to improve their overall environmental profile. Moreover, this review gathered methodologies used to account for LUC impacts and the results obtained. The main constraint of including LUC impacts was the lack of a standardized methodology, as well as large uncertainties in existing methodologies. Conclusions: Most studies concluded that improvements in farming practices might reduce the attributed environmental impacts with the reduction of the amount of land, fertilizer, pesticides, and water used. Studies computing LUC impacts agreed on the importance of including these impacts and concluded that greenhouse gas emissions of bioplastic production would increase, but in most cases would still be lower than the impact of their fossil-based counterparts. However, challenges remain when computing LUC impacts that need to be tackled when working with the available methodologies, including the collection of reliable inventory data (site-specific or regional data) and regionalized characterization factors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11367-020-01829-2,NA
ref_079,"Microplastics contamination in the soil from Urban Landfill site, Dhaka, Bangladesh","Microplastic contamination; Soil; Microplastic identification; FT-IR; Stereomicroscope; Materials science; Chemistry; Agricultural science; Environmental science; Earth sciences © 2020 The Author(s)Microplastics (MP) pollution has become a matter of global concern because of its several deleterious effects on environmental health, especially on the terrestrial environment. The evidence of MP contamination in terrestrial environment is less explored compared to aquatic bodies. However, in Bangladesh despite having high possibility of MP contamination, there is lacking of available research-based evidence. Urban areas soil is subjected to act as a major environmental reservoir for MPs. Thus, this study was carried out to investigate the presence of MP contamination in constructed landfill sites near Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Ten unmixed soil samples were collected from the Aminbazar Sanitary landfill sites, from that thirty replicated samples were investigated via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis and Stereomicroscope. The range of physicochemical parameters were found in the soil samples as follows: moisture content; 15.84%–56.54%; soil pH; 5.76–6.02, electric conductivity; 0.1 μs/cm - 2.43 μs/cm, alkalinity; 6.7 ± 1.528–14.33 ± 0.577, TOC; 0.18% ± 0.02–1.09 ± 0.03. Among the ten samples, 3 samples were identified to have the presence of MP in the form of Low density polyethylene (LDPE), High density polyethylene (HDPE), and Cellulose acetate (CA) respectively. The detection limit ranged from 1 – 2000 μm. Hence, the results show that the procurement and discharge of MPs in the landfills is an overlong process. The results of this study provide an initial evidence and affirm that landfill can be a potential source of MPs. This study indicates that MPs are comparatively overlong outcome of human induced activities which can significantly cause changes in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2020 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05572,microsplastics

We found 45 articles published in peerreviewed scientific journals since 2000 that specifically described teaching methods for GCE. The content of the articles was analyzed based on the categories of the teaching methods used and the revised version of Bloom’s taxonomy. Among the selected articles, collaborative and interdisciplinary learning, and problem-based learning were utilized in 38 and 35 articles, respectively. These were the most frequently used teaching methods, alongside a general combination of multiple teaching methods and teacher presentations. Developing collaborative and interdisciplinary learning skills, techniques for increasing environmental awareness, problemcentered learning skills, and systems thinking skills featuring the teaching methods were seen to promote GCL in 44, 40, 34, and 29 articles, respectively.

In recent trends, urban mining of these metals has received significant attention due to its profitable prospects, extended business opportunity, source of livelihood and ultimately achieving agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030. At the same time, the significant E-waste turns out to be an overwhelming challenge due to the presence of toxic chemical substances. The colossal E-waste generation has created multi-dimensional challenges over existing treatment options with its deleterious impacts on human health and environment. Most of the developed countries are having potential E-waste management technologies, technical knowhow and well-established system boundary. However, the case is not the same with the developing countries due to several challenges and lack of relevant strategies. Lack of data inventorization, illegal dumping, and non-availability of treatment options are the major challenges affecting the entire E-waste value chain in India. Hence, this paper deals with the strategic interventions conforming existing regulations which are crucial for a sustainable E-waste value chain, secured resources, societal well-being, reduced environmental impacts and overall sustainable development. Furthermore, relevant strategies i.e., eco-product design, circular resource management, extended producer responsibility, polluter pays’ principle, life cycle assessment, 4R principle and bioleaching were identified and discussed as a future direction for Indian context.

ref_084,"Past, present, and prospective themes of sustainable agricultural supply chains: A content analysis","Sustainable supply chain management has been a topic of high interest to scholars and practitioners over the last 30 years. Accordingly, many review papers have been published on this topic with various areas of focus. Nevertheless, the overall body of literature still lacks a systematic review that thoroughly explores sustainability-driven decisions in the agriculture sector. To fill this research gap, the present paper presents an extensive review of 247 quantitative studies on sustainable agricultural supply chains. Our review scope includes both crop-based and livestock sectors that are monitored by eco-social corporate initiatives or government sustainability-driven legislation. To do so, we employ a content analysis-based review method, which is well known as an effective means of conducting literature reviews in a transparent, systematic, and rule-governed way, to rigorously collect, filter, and classify the existing research context. We classify the collected materials based on different structural dimensions and related analytic categories, which are obtained from both deductive and inductive categorization techniques. More specifically, we thoroughly evaluate the review results from four research perspectives – agricultural planning, supply chain management, sustainability development, and modeling methodology – aiming at presenting an overview of quantitative research projects.

ref_085,The marine plastic litter issue: A social-economic analysis,"The issue of marine plastic litter pollution is multifaceted, cross-sectoral, and ongoing in the absence of appropriate management measures. This study analysed the issue of marine plastic litter pollution in the context of the Descriptor 10 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Good Environmental Status of the oceans and seas. The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was used to assess the causes, effects, and management measures to changes in the marine environment resulting from marine plastics pollution. We noted that less than 10 peer-reviewed publications have applied the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model to the issue of marine plastics pollution. Some basic needs such as food security, movement of goods and services, and shelter are also some of the major drivers of marine plastic pollution. The use of plastics is linked to multiple economic sectors (fisheries, agriculture, transport, packaging, construction) and other human activities. A significant amount of the resulting pressures came from the economic sectors for packaging and construction. State changes occurred at the environmental (contamination and bioaccumulation), ecosystem (ingestion of plastics, ghost fishing) and ecosystem service levels (supply of sea food, salt and cultural benefits), with possible loss of jobs and income being some of the observed impacts on human welfare. Responses as management measures, which are tailored to meet each component of the DPSIR framework, were identified. These included policies, regulations, technological advancement and behavioural change. The research acknowledges the issue of marine plastics pollution as a global environmental problem and recommends a trans-disciplinary approach, involving all types of stakeholders. Future research and analysis applying the DPSIR framework will be useful to provide the information necessary for the effective, adaptive management of litter pollution by marine plastics. © 2020 by the authors.

ref_095,Motivations for Environmental Alliances: Generating and Internalizing Environmental and Knowledge Value,"Environmental alliances are a common response to societal sustainability demands. In environmental alliances, firms collaboratively exploit and explore environmental technologies to address market opportunities while simultaneously generating positive environmental impacts. A striking idiosyncrasy is that in addition to economic value, environmental alliances generate two types of external value: environmental value from positive effects on air, water, land and biodiversity, and knowledge value from innovations in environmental technologies. Research on motivations for environmental alliances is dispersed and underdeveloped compared to the well-established literature on motivations for strategic alliances that emphasize economic value. This study therefore develops a classification of motivations for environmental alliances by combining the literature on strategic alliances and that on environmental and knowledge value. The resulting classification includes motivations for environmental alliances to generate environmental and knowledge value as well as motivations to create economic value by internalizing environmental and knowledge value. A systematic review of 123 articles on environmental inter-firm alliances identifies specific motivations to populate the new classification. We show that alliance partners are motivated to share sustainable resources, reduce sustainability risk, respond to stakeholders or invest in specific sustainable assets to generate external value. They collaborate to reduce costs or enhance competitive advantage, reputation or legitimacy to internalize external value. The resource-based view, resource-dependence view, institutional theory and transaction cost economics have not previously distinguished between motivations to generate and internalize external value. We extend their area of application from strategic alliances to environmental alliances, and thus beyond the exclusive pursuit of economic value. © 2020 The Authors.

ref_098,Prediction of future carbon footprint and ecosystem service value of carbon sequestration response to nitrogen fertilizer rates in rice production,"There is concern for variations of the carbon footprint (CF) and ecosystem service value of carbon sequestration (ESVCS) related to nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate in rice production under future climate change. To explore possible future ecological effects of N fertilizer rate, a DeNitrification–DeComposition (DNDC) model combined with Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) projections (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were used to predict the CF and ESVCS of rice production. The model was validated by a two-year field experiment, and then seven N fertilizer levels (0, 75, 150, 190, 225, 300, and 375 kg N/ha) were set for prediction from 2015 to 2050. The validation results indicated a good fit between the DNDC-simulated and observed data of GHG emission and rice yield. Under RCP 8.5, the mean CF was 4.5–8.7% higher and the average ESVCS was 3.6–7.4% lower than those under RCP 4.5. The effects of N fertilizer rate on CF and ESVCS were consistent between the two climate change scenarios. In both RCPs, it was found that CF and ESVCS were mainly influenced by N fertilizer rate due to the latter's effect on CH4 emissions and crop carbon fixation. CH4 was the main contributor to CF during 2015–2050, accounting for 43.9–58.3% of the total CF. Agricultural inputs were also large contributors to CF, and N fertilizer increased the indirect GHG emissions by 24.6–122.2% compared with no N fertilization treatment. Among the studied N fertilizer rates, 190 kg N/ha was the optimal rate, obtaining the lowest CF and highest ESVCS. These results indicate that, under future climate change, an N fertilizer rate of 190 kg N/ha could achieve a trade-off between high yield, reduction of CF, and improvement of ESVCS in rice production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139506,ecosystem service example
ref_099,"Nature-based solutions as enablers of circularity in water systems: A review on assessment methodologies, tools and indicators","Water has been pushed into a linear model, which is increasingly acknowledged of causing cumulative emissions of pollutants, waste stocks, and impacting on the irreversible deterioration of water and other resources. Moving towards a circular model in the water sector, the configuration of future water infrastructure changes through the integration of grey and green infrastructure, forming Nature-based Solutions (NBS) as an integral component that connects human-managed to nature-managed water systems. In this study, a thorough appraisal of the latest literature is conducted, providing an overview of the existing tools, methodologies and indicators that have been used to assess NBS for water management, as well as complete water systems considering the need of assessing both anthropogenic and natural elements. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers with respect to existing policies and regulations on NBS and circularity have been identified. The study concludes that the co-benefits of NBS for water management are not adequately assessed. A holistic methodology assessing complete water systems from a circularity perspective is still needed integrating existing tools (i.e. hydro-biogeochemical models), methods (i.e. MFA-based and LCA) and incorporating existing and/or newly-developed indicators. © 2020 The Authors",10.1016/j.watres.2020.115988,"nature based solutions

ref_100,Increasing plant diversity offsets the influence of coarse sand on ecosystem services in microcosms of constructed wetlands,"As wastewater treatment systems that strengthen natural processes, constructed wetlands provide both ecosystem services and disservices. Manipulating both the physical and ecological structures of constructed wetlands has been the key to improve ecosystem services while reducing disservices. Herein, an experiment using simulated constructed wetlands was conducted to explore the effect of two different substrate sizes (fine sand or coarse sand), plant richness (1, 3, or 4 species), and plant species identity on ecosystem services. Results indicated that (1) only in microcosms with coarse sand, species richness enhanced nitrogen removal efficiency while reduced nitrous oxide emissions and that (2) the presence of Phalaris arundinacea increased nitrogen removal rate, and the presence of Rumex japonicus or Oenanthe javanica decreased nitrous oxide emissions; (3) however, the net ecosystem services (nitrogen removal, greenhouse gas emissions, biofuel production) of microcosms with fine sand were higher than those of microcosms with coarse sand, and (4) interestingly, there was no difference in net ecosystem services between microcosms with coarse sand (1033 yuan ha−1 day−1; 1 yuan ≈ 0.14 USD) and those with fine sand (1071 yuan ha−1 day−1) for the four-species mixtures. Hence, in practice, ensuring plant species richness with appropriate species in microcosms with coarse sand can improve ecosystem services to a level equal to that of microcosms with fine sand and help to prevent constructed wetlands from clogging. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11356-020-09592-5,ecosystems services example?
ref_104,Circular economy and economic development in the European Union: A review and bibliometric analysis,"Increased changes in the climate and ecosystems call for a sustainable economic development, where economic growth should be compatible with the environment goals. In order to do this, it is urgent to find new ways of life and new production systems that make our ecological footprint compatible with global sustainability. The concept of the circular economy has brought relevant contributions to this problem. The central objective of the study presented here is to highlight the main insights presented through scientific literature about the concept of the circular economy within the European Union. In practice, the intention is to show what has already been done about this topic and what can/should be implemented in the future. To achieve these objectives, 144 articles were considered from the Web of Science (Core Collection) for the topics ""circular economy"" and ""European Union"". These documents were, firstly, analysed through a proper literature review and later explored through bibliometric analysis, considering bibliographic data and the VOSviewer software. As the main findings have revealed, the increased importance of this concept within the European Union is recognized.

ref_109,Greening the browns: A bio-based land use framework for analysing the potential of urban brownfields in an urban circular economy,"The Circular Economy (CE) is expected to accelerate the use of resources with bio-based origin. Cities have an important role in such an economy, not only as main consumers but also because vegetation provides numerous ecosystem services essential for the well-being of urban dwellers. Urban lands are, however, heavily burdened with both past and present activities and ongoing urbanization. Retrofitting obsolete and potentially contaminated brownfields provides an opportunity to engage with bio-based land uses within the city. At the same time, plants are an important part of Gentle Remediation Options (GROs), a more sustainable alternative for managing contamination risks and restoring soil health. This paper (1) provides a tentative selection of Urban Greenspaces (UGSs) relevant for brownfields, and a compilation of ecosystem services provided by the selected UGSs, and (2) presents a framework covering the 14 selected bio-based land uses on brownfields, including GRO interventions over time. This framework provides three practical tools: the conceptualization of linkages between GROs and prospective UGS uses, a scatter diagram for the realization of 14 UGS opportunities on brownfields, and a decision matrix to analyze the requirements for UGS realization on brownfields. © 2020 by the authors.",10.3390/SU12156278,NA
ref_111,Plastic pollution in the marine environment,"Plastic pollution is recognized as a severe anthropogenic issue in the coastal and marine ecosystems across the world. Unprecedented and continuous accumulation of growing plastic contaminants into any respective aquatic ecosystem by the anthropogenic sources causes direct and/or indirect interruption to ecosystem structure, functions, and consequently, services and values. Land-based and sea-based sources are the primary sources of these contaminants in various modes that enter the ocean. In this review paper, we focused on highlighting different aspects related to plastic pollution in coastal and marine environments. Plastic pollutants are distributed in the ecosystems in different forms, with different size variations as megaplastic, macroplastic, mesoplastic, and microplastic. Microplastics in primary and secondary forms reveal a widespread distribution in the water, sediment, and biota of the marine and coastal habitats. The microplastic level of different coastal and marine ecosystems nearly ranged from 0.001-140 particles/m3 in water and 0.2-8766 particles/m3 in sediments at different aquatic environments over the world. The microplastic accumulation rate of coastal and marine organisms varied at 0.1-15,033 counts. Accordingly, plastic pollution creates several kinds of negative consequences combined with ecological and socio-economic effects. Entanglement, toxicological effects via ingestion of plastics, suffocation, starvation, dispersal, and rafting of organisms, provision of new habitats, and introduction of invasive species are significant ecological effects with growing threats to biodiversity and trophic relationships. Degradation (changes in the ecosystem state) and modifications of marine systems are associated with loss of ecosystem services and values. Consequently, this emerging contaminant affects the socio-economic aspects through negative impacts on tourism, fishery, shipping, and human health. Preventing accumulation sources of plastic pollutants, 3Rs (Reduce-Recycle-Reuse), awareness &amp; capacity building, and producer/manufacturer responsibility are practical approaches toward addressing the issue of plastic pollution. Existing and adopted policies, legislations, regulations, and initiatives at global, regional, and national level play a vital role in reducing plastic debris in the marine and coastal zones. Development of proposals/solutions on key research gaps can open a novel pathway to address this environmental issue in an effective scientific manner. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the current status of plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem to make aware people of a plastic-free, healthy blue ocean in the near future. © 2020 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04709,Plastic pollution literature
ref_112,Consumer-based actions to reduce plastic pollution in rivers: A multi-criteria decision analysis approach,"The use and management of single use plastics is a major area of concern for the public, regulatory and business worlds. Focusing on the most commonly occurring consumer plastic items present in European freshwater environments, we identified and evaluated consumer-based actions with respect to their direct or indirect potential to reduce macroplastic pollution in freshwater environments. As the main end users of these items, concerned consumers are faced with a bewildering array of choices to reduce their plastics footprint, notably through recycling or using reusable items. Using a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach, we explored the effectiveness of 27 plastic reduction actions with respect to their feasibility, economic impacts, environmental impacts, unintended social/environmental impacts, potential scale of change and evidence of impact. The top ranked consumer-based actions were identified as: using wooden or reusable cutlery; switching to reusable water bottles; using wooden or reusable stirrers; using plastic free cotton-buds; and using refill detergent/ shampoo bottles. We examined the feasibility of top-ranked actions using a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) to explore the complexities inherent in their implementation for consumers, businesses, and government to reduce the presence of plastic in the environment. © 2020 Marazzi et al.

ref_118,The world on fire: A buddhist response to the environmental crisis,"This paper identifies and responds to the four main objections raised against Buddhist environmentalism. It argues that none of these objections is insurmountable and that, in fact, Buddhists have developed numerous concepts, arguments, and practices which could prove useful for dealing with the most pressing environmental problems we have created. Buddhism is sometimes described by its critics as too detached from worldly concerns to respond to the environmental crisis but the successes of Engaged Buddhism demonstrate otherwise. Although halting climate change will require inter-governmental co-operation and immediate action, we should not underestimate the necessity of grassroots movements for achieving lasting change in our attitudes and behaviours. If meditation can awaken us to the fact of ecological inter-connectedness and to the ultimate drivers of climate change (e.g., greediness and a misplaced sense of entitlement) it can also help us reconnect with nature and expand our circle of moral concern to include plants, animals, and the wider environment. © 2020 by the author.

ref_120,Restorative and regenerative: Exploring the concepts in the circular economy,"The most recognized definition of the circular economy is that it is a restorative and regenerative economy. Despite the wide use and importance attributed to the concepts of “restoration” and “regeneration,” they are rarely defined or explained in the circular economy literature. In this context, this study critically examines the two terms, while providing guidance on their future utilization and development. Specifically, the study investigates the origin of the concepts, their adoption in frameworks that anticipated the idea of the circular economy, and their connotations in the circular economy literature. The examination supports the need for clear and distinct definitions, combined with precision in usage. From a review of the literature, restoration is a better-defined concept than regeneration, although it needs conceptual re-enforcement relative to the biological/ecological aspects of the circular economy. This study suggests looking in the direction of restoration ecology, a well-established branch of ecological research. Conversely, regeneration is a symbolic/evocative term with little practical application in the context of circular systems except in the case of certain agricultural practices. Until new conceptual developments intervene, regeneration does not seem to be applicable to the economy as a whole and because of this, might be abandoned as a guiding principle of the circular economy. Unlike regeneration, restoration can be considered a core principle because it has widespread application and can be a point of reference for circular applications. This does not preclude the possibility that other concepts may be needed to augment restoration. © 2020 The Authors.

ref_122,Plastics as a materials system in a circular economy: Plastics in the Circular Economy,"Plastics have transformed our modern world. With a range of outstanding properties, they are used in an ever-widening range of applications. However, the linear economy of their use means that a large volume of plastics is discarded after use. It is believed that approximately 80% of the estimated total 6.3 Bt of plastics ever produced have been discarded, representing not only a huge loss of valuable resources, but mismanaged waste is also the origin of an ever-increasing environmental disaster. Strategies to prevent loss of materials resources and damage to the environment are elements of a circular plastics economy that aims to maintain plastics at their highest value for the longest time possible and at the same time improve the economy and prevent detrimental environmental impact. The latter in particular is driving recent changes in policies and legislation across the world that are rapidly being introduced in order to solve these environmental issues. The achievement of a circular economy will require not only innovative technical developments, but also major economic investment and changes to business practice coupled with significant changes in social behaviour. This paper summarizes the complex and highly interrelated technical issues and provides an overview of the major challenges, potential solutions and opportunities required to achieve and operate a circular plastics economy.

ref_123,"The Unintended Side Effects of Bioplastics: Carbon, Land, and Water Footprints","The environmental impacts of plastics have become an important political and academic topic. One of the main applications of plastics is packaging, a product with a very short service life, leading to a wide range of environmental problems. In this Perspective, we look at the potential environmental consequences (in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and land and water footprints) of substitution of petrochemical plastics used for packaging in Europe with bioplastics. The research is based on a review of life cycle impact assessment studies and additional calculations to assess the footprints of this substitution. The results demonstrate that currently it does not seem feasible to replace all the petrochemical plastic packaging with bioplastic because this will inevitably result in a considerable increase of land and water use. Unless we find ways to decrease plastic demand, most of the efforts to stop plastic pollution are likely to prove temporary and inadequate. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.In this Perspective, Brizga et al. assess the potential environmental consequences (in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and land and water footprints) of substituting petrochemical plastics with bioplastics produced from renewable feedstock.

ref_124,An urgent call for circular economy advocates to acknowledge its limitations in conserving biodiversity,"This discussion paper explores the relationship between biodiversity and the circular economy and the potential implications of this relationship. The circular economy has emerged as an alternative model to a traditional linear economy. It aims to tackle the resource exploitation that accompanies a linear economy and decouple economic growth from reliance on primary resources. In the face of global environmental degradation and an urgent need for change, the concept has become popular around the world and has led to the release of national policies and strategies on the circular economy. Problematically, while the basic concept is clear, it is ambiguous in how it will achieve some of its objectives, and it fails to address some key issues. In light of the accelerating rate of change, precipitous biodiversity decline is one such key issue. Through a content analysis of relevant circular economy publications, authors demonstrate that biodiversity protection is rarely mentioned in theory and policy. While the circular economy holds many benefits for society, its evasion of scrutiny has prevented it from manifesting in a comprehensive solution to environmental issues. The circular economy advocates for biomimicry, ecosystem service valuation, bioeconomy, and renewable energy. Each of these, however, has its own set of conflicts with biodiversity protection. Given the imminent need to protect biodiversity, the authors call for further research on the interaction between biodiversity and the circular economy, and for circular economy advocates to explicitly acknowledge the concept's limitations, thereby revealing the need for intersectional and complementary policies which aim to protect biodiversity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138602,NA
ref_125,Measuring the environmental performance of a circular system: Emergy and LCA approach on a recycle polystyrene system,"The search for sustainability has pointed to the need to transition from a linear to a circular model. However, such a transition is not trivial. Modifying production chains with the focus on reducing virgin raw materials consumption, cut emissions, and prevent waste generation implies implementing new processes and services, which can add considerable environmental impacts to the supply chain. This paper analyzes a real case from a production system aligned with circular economy principles. The production system consists of the manufacturing of baseboards made of recycled Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), obtained from an extensive reverse logistics system composed of different recycling processes. The system's potential environmental impacts were assessed by two widely used methodologies, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Emergy Analysis (EMA). For comparison purposes, the analysis was carried out for a fictional linear production system, in which the baseboard would be made of virgin EPS. EMA attributed a lower emergy load to the circular scenario compared to the linear scenario (8.62E+15 seJ to recycled EPS versus 1.26E+16 seJ to virgin EPS). LCA results indicate both scenarios as environmental preferable depending on the impact category under analysis (e.g. circular system has better performance regarding global warming, while the linear scenario demonstrated better results under water consumption). For the circular scenario, EMA identified the main impact drivers, such as transportation and electricity consumption. From LCA perspective impacts are also driven by electricity consumption. However, differently from EMA, logistics were only significant for Land Use impact category whereas Liquefied Petroleum Gas consumption and, landfill air emissions were identified as impact hotspots. These convergences and differences between the findings of LCA and EMA have demonstrated potentially complementation to broaden available information related to systems, enabling decision makers to act effectively in improving the environmental performance of their production processes, especially when implementing circular practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138111,NA
ref_128,Ocean plastic crisis—Mental models of plastic pollution from remote Indonesian coastal communities,"The crisis facing the world’s oceans from plastics is well documented, yet there is little knowledge of the perspectives, experiences and options of the coastal communities facing overwhelming quantities of plastics on their beaches and in their fishing waters. In emerging economies such as those in the Coral Triangle, the communities affected are among the poorest of their countries. To understand the consequences of ocean plastic pollution in coastal regions, through the eyes of local people, this study examines the knowledge, use, disposal and local consequences of single use plastics in remote island communities in two archipelagos of southern Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using mixed methods—a survey of plastic literacy and behaviour, household interviews about purchasing and disposal, and focus group discussions to generate shared mental models—we identify a complex set of factors contributing to extensive plastic leakage into the marine environment. The rising standard of living has allowed people in low resource, remote communities to buy more single-use plastic items than they could before. Meanwhile complex geography and minimal collection services make waste management a difficult issue, and leave the communities themselves to shoulder the impacts of the ocean plastic crisis. Although plastic literacy is low, there is little the coastal communities can do unless presented with better choice architecture both on the supply side and in disposal options. Our results suggest that for such coastal communities improved waste disposal is urgent. Responsible supply chains and non-plastic alternatives are needed. Producers and manufacturers can no longer focus only on low-cost packaged products, without taking responsibility for the outcomes. Without access to biodegradable, environmentally friendly products, and a circular plastic system, coastal communities and surrounding marine ecosystems will continue to be inundated in plastic waste. © 2020 Phelan et al.

The oceanic islands are one of the most affected places by this type of material. A significant case of plastic pollution occurs in the Galapagos Islands. The Galapagos Islands, located west of Ecuador, have one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. It is the home of unique species in the world, and since 1978 it has been considered as a Natural World Heritage. However, the Galapagos Islands are threatened by plastic pollution. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the cost of environmental damage generated by plastic waste in the Galapagos Islands. The non-market economic valuation approach was used to implement contingent valuation. It was determined that the Willingness to Pay of Ecuadorian families, to reduce plastic pollution, was between US$ 4.90 - US$ 14.51 per year, with a median of US$ 7.65.

The performances of reused materials were assessed using turf with trays on a roof for two years in Chiba, Japan. Two types of materials, a commercial green roof substrate and cocopeat, were used as the substrate. For the drainage layers, five different materials were used: a commercial green roof drainage layer, bamboo stems and nodes, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle caps and bottoms. In addition, a sample without any drainage layer was used. The trays were prepared with the combination of these two substrates and six drainage applications. Overall, reused materials were observed to function well as commercial green roof materials. The turf in cocopeat was able to survive better than turf in commercial green roof substrate. In the drainage layers, some reused materials, such as the PET bottle caps and bamboo nodes, showed higher final plant coverage than commercial drainage layers in cocopeat.

ref_144,Circular Economy as Fictional Expectation to Overcome Societal Addictions. Where Do We Stand?,"Circular economy thinking has become the subject of academic enquiry across several disciplines recently. Yet whilst its technical and business angles are more widely discussed, its philosophical underpinnings and socio-economic implications are insufficiently investigated. In this article, we aim to contribute to their understanding by uncovering the circular economy role in shaping a new vision, highlighting the social and economic dimensions of future imaginaries and the mechanisms that can enable them to bring about change in the social context. We believe that defining the vision that the circular economy is contributing to shape is key to explain its conceptual framework and activities. Drawing on the concept of fictional expectations, we uncover one of the plausible social dimensions inherent to the circular economy thinking thereby opening up a new perspective on the current debate in the circular economy literature wherein authors, by contrast, are emphasising the lack of an explicit social dimension. Fictional expectations are introduced to refer to those imaginaries of the future that can catalyse social action in the present and counteract societal addictions, in which modern society seems to be trapped. We show how a circular economy inspired vision can be instrumental to the emergence of a fictional expectation that can provide therapies to the current societal addiction of wasteful production and consumption systems. This philosophical background allows us to provide, in conclusion, a new conceptualisation of the circular economy as a cognitive framework instrumental to the emergence of a future imaginary. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s40926-020-00128-y,circular economy
ref_145,Impacts of marine plastic on ecosystem services and economy: State of South African research,"In addition to its direct impacts on marine ecology and biota, marine plastic debris can affect the delivery of ecosystem services, with resulting impacts on human well-being, society and the economy. It is important to quantify these impacts in economic terms, so as to be able to provide evidence-based support for an appropriate policy response. We review the South African literature on the impacts of marine plastic debris on ecosystem services and on the economy, in order to identify relevant knowledge gaps. The gaps are found to be significant. Some research has been conducted in terms of impacts relating to recreation, aesthetics and tourism and the costs of beach and harbour clean-ups. However, there is a significant lack of research regarding impacts on ecosystem services relating to fisheries and aquaculture, heritage, habitat provision, biodiversity, and nutrient cycles. There is also a significant lack of research regarding direct economic impacts on the transport/shipping and fisheries industries, indirect economic impacts (such as costs associated with health-related impacts), and non-market costs (e.g. impacts on scenic, cultural and spiritual values). More research is needed in South Africa to address these gaps, in order to inform policy aimed at addressing plastic waste and marine plastic debris. Significance: • This review highlights the knowledge gaps in terms of the impacts of marine plastics on ecosystem services and on the economy in South Africa, which are important to understand in order to be able to direct funding for future research in this domain. Without better knowledge of the economic impacts of marine plastic debris, it is difficult to assess the costs of inaction, and therefore to inform an appropriate policy response for tackling the problem of marine plastic debris. © 2020.

ref_149,Additive sustainability footprint: Rationale and pilot evaluation of a tool for assessing the sustainable use of PVC additives,"PVC compounds contain additives necessary for processing and stability, and to modify the plastic's properties. The Europe-wide VinylPlus® voluntary commitment includes a challenge to make progress toward sustainable use of additives. Additive Sustainability Footprint (ASF) was developed to assess sustainable use of additives across the whole societal life cycles of finished PVC articles, taking a risk-based approach rather than simplistic hazard assessment. ASF addresses impacts across six life cycle assessment (LCA) stages established by ISO Standard 14040, using the four System Conditions (sustainability principles) developed by The Natural Step (TNS) covering social as well as environmental factors. For each LCA stage/System Condition combination, seven generically similar questions cover negative impacts (many covered by existing tools and regulations) but also the additive's positive contributions to the sustainability of finished articles. Positive contributions include ethical sourcing, longevity of service life, low maintenance inputs, and recyclability. Answers to questions determine a score, which can be combined across the life cycle and with other additives. Testing on a generic EU PVC window profile supported ASF development and demonstrated applicability and potential benefits including use for sensitivity analysis of alternative additives from different geopolitical regions or from recycled as opposed to virgin sources.

ref_150,"Low incidence of microplastic contaminants in Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas Thunberg) from the Salish Sea, USA","Plastic pollution is a threat to marine life with long term impacts to ecosystems and organisms in the sea. In this study, we quantified the presence of microparticles in wild populations of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from the Salish Sea, Washington State. Examination under a dissecting microscope revealed 63% of oysters contained microparticles (~1.75 microparticles per oyster) and microfibers were the dominant type of particles. Using Raman microspectroscopy (RMS) and Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (μ-FTIR) we found that only ~2% of these microparticles were synthetic and included polymers such as polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(bisphenol A carbonate), rayon, and polyacrylate. It is important to note that of the 447 microparticles analyzed with RMS, 41% showed fluorescence interference, impeding the determination of their identification. The remaining microparticles were cellulose derivatives, shell fragments, biological or proteinaceous material, salts, minerals, and gypsum. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy equipped with a diamond attenuated total reflectance accessory (ATR-FTIR) showed the presence of sorbitan derivatives in all samples examined (n = 213). These findings provide the first baseline for microplastic and other particles in oysters from the west coast of the United States integrating results from ATR-FTIR, μ-FTIR, and RMS, in addition to visual sorting. These results suggest there is low retention of plastic particles in Pacific oysters from the Salish Sea, but further research is needed to determine the composition of microparticles with fluorescence interference. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136826,Mircoplasticos
ref_153,Making the circular economy work for human development,"This paper aims to re-conceptualise and advance the existing frameworks and practical applications of the circular economy (CE) towards a broader approach to development in general and, more particularly, to combine it with the approach for Human Development (HD). The CE is an alternative to the current ""take, make, waste” extractive industrial model and offers a practical solution to address global and local environmental challenges, such as resource depletion, marine plastic pollution, and for staying within planetary system boundaries. Although the CE and related concepts such as cradle to cradle provide a most promising alternative to the traditional linear economy model and its impacts on the planets eco-systems, some of the CE key elements have raised debate both in the academic community and among policy makers. One of the debates concerns the missing social or human dimensions of the CE. Likewise, the HD approach lacks considerations of environmental sustainability. Drawing on both academic and grey literature and the authorsö research observations and professional experiences in the fields of promoting the CE and international development cooperation for HD, we attempt to develop an integrative conceptual framework of the CE and HD. This framework includes social-economic elements of the transformation from linear to circular economic models, combined with HD from the social sciences and development studies. We thereby complement the technological-material focused CE model that is primarily based on principles of industrial ecology and engineering. We utilize the existing ‘circular humansphereö concept to articulate the incorporation of HD into the discussion of CE. By bringing in explicit links with HD, we pursue a double aim: First, to raise awareness and understanding among the CE research community of the missing human dimension in current CE discourse, and second, to familiarise the international development community with the approaches of CE. This will advance the options for adopting CE practices in international development programmes and for the process of implementing the social SDGs concerning HD such as SDG 1, 3, 4, 5, and 10. Finally, we hope that this CE and HD framework can contribute to the resolution of environmental and developmental issues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104686,More on Circular Economy
ref_159,Entrapment in plastic debris endangers hermit crabs,"Significant quantities of plastic debris pollute nearly all the world's ecosystems, where it persists for decades and poses a considerable threat to flora and fauna. Much of the focus has been on the marine environment, with little information on the hazard posed by debris accumulating on beaches and adjacent vegetated areas. Here we investigate the potential for beach debris to disrupt terrestrial species and ecosystems on two remote islands. The significant quantities of debris on the beaches, and throughout the coastal vegetation, create a significant barrier which strawberry hermit crabs (Coenobita perlatus) encounter during their daily activities. Around 61,000 (2.447 crabs/m2) and 508,000 crabs (1.117 crabs/m2) are estimated to become entrapped in debris and die each year on Henderson Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, respectively. Globally, there is an urgent need to establish a clear link between debris interactions and population persistence, as loss of biodiversity contributes to ecosystem degradation. Our findings show accumulating debris on these islands has the potential to seriously impact hermit crab populations. This is important for countless other islands worldwide where crabs and debris overlap, as crabs play a crucial role in the maintenance of tropical ecosystems. © 2019 The Authors",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121703,"Yes

ref_160,Microplastics in Mexican beaches,"Mexican sandy beaches are a natural resource that provides environmental services and contribute to the economic growth of the country. However, due to mismanagement of solid waste, discharges of wastewaters and other land and marine activities, they can be polluted by microplastics. This research aimed to quantify and classify the microplastics found in Mexican beaches. Samples were taken in 33 beaches, along the five marine regions of the country, following a systematic method that allows comparison of results. Microplastics concentration varied from 31.7–545.8 M P/m2, with high variance coefficients (28.7–122.3 %). The Gulf of California was the region that showed a higher mean concentration. Presence of microplastics was higher in urban-overdeveloped beaches and increased with the occurrence of extreme weather events. Prevention of pollution of beaches by microplastics would allow to preserve the natural resources of the country, as well as to recover valuable materials that can be reinserted in production cycles. © 2019",10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.104633,NA
ref_163,The rise and demise of plastic shopping bags in Chile – Broad and informal coalition supporting ban as a first step to reduce single-use plastics,"Single-use plastic bags (SUPBs) were introduced to society as a way to facilitate our daily lives, but due to their low post-use value they are found as litter in many different environments, from urban to rural and remote, natural environments. Given the increasing awareness about environmental litter, many communities have banned SUPBs in the recent past. Here we explore an emerging economy to document the rise and demise of SUPBs in society. Through a review of scientific and grey literature (including governmental documents and media coverage) we reconstruct the timeline of SUPBs in Chile, including the development of the plastic industry and retail business within Chile, the introduction, spread and finally the demise of SUPBs. Focused on the demise phase, we document the creation and succession of municipal ordinances to reduce SUPBs in local commerce, and the development of a national law to regulate the use of SUPBs. In order to document the involvement of the general public during the demise phase, we also examined current behavior and behavioral intentions of people in (i) a local project introducing reusable cloth bags to reduce the use of SUPBs, and (ii) a consumer survey about public perception of SUPBs and their use. Plastic bags were introduced in Chile in the 1970s, then spread with the emergence of supermarkets and retail stores in the 1980s and 1990s, and were widely used in commerce by the turn of the century. During the first decade of the 21st century the first scientific studies reported large amounts of plastic litter and high proportions of single-use plastics in coastal environments, public awareness grew, and numerous initiatives aiming to reduce consumption and littering of plastics developed. The first municipal ban of SUPBs in 2013 was emulated during the following five years by 62 other Chilean municipalities and in 2018 translated into a national law, which was highly approved and supported by the population. We conclude that the ban of SUBPs in Chile was facilitated by a broad concern among the general public, which led to a bottom-up movement culminating in the national government taking stakes in the issue. Finally, we argue that this can only be a first step that must be followed by further actions to abolish single-use products in order to effectively protect the environment and in particular the world's oceans. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105079,"Maybe not for Everest Bios

ref_168,Toward sustainable climate change adaptation,"Industrial ecology (IE) has made great contributions to climate change mitigation research, in terms of its systems thinking and solid methodologies such as life cycle assessment, material flow analysis, and environmentally extended input–output analysis. However, its potential contribution to climate change adaptation is unclear. Adaptation has become increasingly urgent in a continuously changing climate, especially in developing countries, which are projected to bear the brunt of climate-change-related damages. On the basis of a brief review of climate change impacts and adaptation literature, we suggest that IE can play an important role in the following two aspects. First, with the emphasis on a systems perspective, IE can help us determine how climate change interacts with our socio-economic system and how the interactions may aggravate (or moderate) its direct impacts or whether they may shift burden to other environmental impacts. Second, IE methodologies can help us quantify the direct and indirect environmental impacts of adaptation activities, identify mitigation opportunities, and achieve sustainable adaptation. Further, we find that substantial investment is needed to increase the resilience of infrastructure (e.g., transport, energy, and water supply) and agriculture in developing countries. Because these sectors are also the main drivers of environmental degradation, how to achieve sustainable climate-resilient infrastructure and agriculture in developing countries deserves special attention in future IE studies. Overall, IE thinking and methodologies have great potential to contribute to climate change adaptation research and policy questions, and exploring this growing field will, in turn, inspire IE development. © 2020 by Yale University",10.1111/jiec.12984,adaptation in climate change
ref_169,Potential Use of Earthworms to Enhance Decaying of Biodegradable Plastics,"Biosolid application, wastewater irrigation, and plastic mulching technologies are major sources of plastic pollution in agroecosystems. Microplastics may interact with soil physicochemical properties and organisms and negatively affect plant growth. To alleviate environmental plastic pollution, synthetic and biobased biodegradable polymers are replacing nonbiodegradable polymers, but their biodegradation rate in the field is frequently lower than that estimated from standardized biodegradation testing. Plastic polymer biodegradation is a multistep process that involves plastic deterioration, microbial colonization, production of polymer-degrading exoenzymes, and mineralization. However, these physicochemical and biological processes are not always efficient because of unfavorable environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, soil moisture). We propose to use earthworms to increase the biodegradable polymer biodegradation rate by creating optimal habitats for microbial proliferation. Earthworm-induced processes that lead to soil alteration (bioturbation) and solid organic wastes decomposition (vermicomposting) are described to understand how earthworms may favor biodegradable plastic mineralization. Therefore, we suggest two practical sustainable bioengineering strategies: (1) enhancing bioturbation by inoculating agricultural soils with soil-dwelling earthworms, which is viable for horticulture where using biodegradable mulching films increases plastic debris in the soil and (2) vermicomposting with blended biodegradable plastic debris and solid organic wastes, which is complementary to industrial or home composting of single-use biodegradable plastics. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b05450,Usando los muchachos para la polution?
ref_173,Indicator development as a site of collective imagination? The case of European Commission policies on the circular economy,"In recent years the concept of the circular economy gained prominence in EU policy-making. The circular economy promotes a future in which linear ‘make-use-dispose’ cultures are replaced by more circular models. In this paper, we use the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries to ask how an imaginary of circularity has been assembled and stabilized, which imaginative resources were drawn on, and how goals, priorities, benefits and risks haven been merged with discourses of innovation, sustainability and growth. Drawing on policy documents and interviews with policy officers of the European Commission, we argue that the monitoring framework and indicator development function as a site collective imagination in which desirable ‘circular’ futures are co-produced. These futures are imagined to provide novel opportunities for the private sector and to generate jobs and economic growth while at the same time improving the natural environment as measured by selected environmental indicators. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

ref_174,Valuation of marine plastic pollution in the European Arctic: Applying an integrated choice and latent variable model to contingent valuation,"Despite its remoteness, marine plastic pollution is a significant environmental problem in the Arctic. In Svalbard, for example, plastics are found on the shorelines, in the water column, on the ocean floor and in the ice. Organisms have been observed to be entangled in nets and ingestion of plastics has been documented in a range of organisms. Notably almost all Arctic bird species have been found to have ingested plastic, with Northern fulmars being particularly affected, with 89 % of samples recorded as having ingested plastic. Identification and valuation of ecosystem services affected by marine plastic pollution can provide input for decision makers in evaluating and comparing management policies concerning this unique environment. This study employs the contingent valuation method (CVM) for eliciting the willingness to pay (WTP) of Norwegian households for reducing marine plastic pollution around the archipelago of Svalbard. An Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model (ICLV) is employed to explore attitudinal determinants of WTP. We find an average WTP for an initiative to reduce marine plastics of NOK 5,485 (USD 642) per household per year. The ICLV results reveal that people who are relatively more concerned about marine plastic pollution and who deem the proposed initiative effective are willing to pay more (up to 85 % and 50 %, respectively). The use of ICLV models in CVM and recommendations for future research are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106521,Plastics in marine ecosytems

Public understandings of plastic pollution,"This paper explores people's knowledge and understandings of microplastics; the role of media in framing perceptions and socio-cultural dimensions to popular solutions to reduce single-use plastics. We conducted 6 focus groups (2016–17) involving participants with no obvious knowledge of microplastics and some with special interest. Most people were unaware of microplastics though environmentally conscious participants had heard of microbeads due to media reporting concerning regulation. Few made connections between their personal use of plastics and ocean pollution. Plastic pollution was associated with macro-plastic ‘islands’ in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and powerful media images of charismatic wildlife entanglement remote from participants lives. The scale of microplastics (not easily detected), poor understanding of the science behind microplastics and cultural ideas about healthy and appropriate behaviour presents barriers to change. Science communicators, NGOs, industry and policy makers must take account of media representations and the culturally embedded nature of plastics in society. © 2018",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.110908,Microplastics
ref_178,Towards an ecology of soil microplastics,"Microplastic pollution is a topic of increasing concern for the world's oceans, freshwaters and, most recently, soils. Microplastics have been found in soils across the globe. Like other anthropogenic pollutants, they can negatively affect a range of soil organisms through several mechanisms, though often dependent on particle size, shape and polymer type. However, microplastics are unique among pollutants due to the diversity of ways in which soil organisms may themselves be able to affect their occurrence and distribution and mediate their effects on the rest of the soil food web. In this review, we argue for a more explicitly ecological framing of this novel issue for the soil environment and discuss their potential interactions with soil communities, including microplastic formation via microbial and faunal fragmentation of large plastic debris and organisms such as earthworms placing microplastic particles in unique pedological contexts they could not otherwise reach. Ecological interactions may be crucial for dictating microplastics’ ultimate fate and effect on terrestrial ecosystems.

ref_179,Incorporating environmental impacts into the economic evaluation of health care systems: Perspectives from ecological economics,"Health care is responsible for a range of negative environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, plastics waste, and pharmaceutical pollution of ecosystems through excretion and inappropriate disposal. Evidence on the scale of these impacts has been growing in high-income countries. To date, there has been only limited discussion of how environmental impacts might be incorporated into economic evaluations of health care programs, including health technology assessment. This paper considers why and how this aim might be achieved, using perspectives from both mainstream and ecological economics. There are strong arguments for using economic evaluation to internalise the negative environmental externalities currently being generated by health care, as well as precautionary arguments for health systems to better understand their exposure to their environmental impacts. The paper tests the feasibility of incorporating the costs of greenhouse gas emissions within costing for economic evaluation, and concludes that the use of shadow prices to achieve this aim is feasible. It suggests that this cost-based approach is preferable to more convoluted attempts to incorporate environmental impacts in the outcome component of health economic evaluations. The interaction between overuse, antimicrobial resistance and environmental harms of health care is identified as an area that would benefit from investigation using innovative economic methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.104623,Interesante ejemplo de health industry

ref_189,Microplastics in Soil Ecosystem: Insight on Its Fate and Impacts on Soil Quality,"Plastic film has been intensively used in (semi-)arid agricultural regions, attributing to its great benefits of improving soil productivity and crop yield in China. However, plastic debris, as a consequence of film mulching, remains and accumulates in soil leading to severe soil quality problems, as well as environmental concerns especially the small fragmented particles referred to as microplastics (MPs). Though increasing attention has been aroused for MPs in the aquatic environment, the knowledge of MPs’ behavior and its effects on soil quality is extremely insufficient and urgently needed. In this study, we oriented the benefits of plastic film use, its contribution to agriculture productivity, and the effects of MPs on soil properties and its related soil quality indicators. Admittedly, the increasing trend of using plastic film made by light density of polyethylene would be continued in China, and the pieces of plastic particles would either be persistent and accumulated in soil layers or be slowly aging and degraded. The impacts of MPs on soil quality need more attention due to the limited studies available focusing on its fate and interactions associated with soil ecosystem services and environmental resilience. Although policies and agricultural extending services on plastic film application have been laughed for a few years, alternative materials used for producing environment-friendly film, plastic debris recycling, and solutions on pieced particle removal are the great challenges for sustainable farming. Thus, it is urgent to understand MPs’ effects on soil quality which is crucial for soil-plant system and soil pollution monitoring and prevention. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/698_2020_458,"Yes,

ref_190,Optimization of the municipal solid waste management system using a hybrid life cycle assessment–emergy approach in Tehran,"The sustainable design of the waste-management system is of crucial importance for cities like Tehran, capital of Iran. Tehran’s municipal solid-waste management has adopted modern practices and technologies very slowly. This study proposes the optimum pathway to reach maximum environmental benefits as well as the most cost-effective technologies according to the financial limits. The hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA)–emergy approach is applied to utilize the life cycle emissions as an inventory database to estimate the ecosystem services provided by the natural ecosystem to dilute the emissions and compensate raw material consumption. Among organic waste-treatment options, composting is optimally chosen by the hybrid LCA–emergy approach while considering the LCA method solely; the anaerobic digestion is the preferable option. Recycling is the most preferable solution for paper, plastic, and glass in terms of energy recovery and cost saving. However, the budget constraint affects the results. Considering the budget constraint, 65% of ferrous metals are diverted from recycling into metal landfill. Cost reduction of recycling technologies may divert metal flow from landfill to recycling. The limited budget has a significant impact on recycling solutions. Overall, the combination of composting and source separation should be considered as the most sustainable and eco-friendly pathway in Tehran. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10163-019-00919-0,"Yes

ref_192,Review of emergy analysis and life cycle assessment: Coupling development perspective,"Two methods of natural ecosystem assessment-emergy analysis (EMA) and life cycle assessment (LCA)-are reviewed in this paper. Their advantages, disadvantages, and application areas are summarized, and the similarities and differences between these two evaluation methods are analyzed respectively. Their research progress is also sorted out. The study finds that EMA and LCA share common attributes in evaluation processes and research fields, but they focus on different aspects of macrocosms and microcosms. The assessment of system sustainability is valued by both EMA and LCA, but the former has unique advantages in natural system input analysis, and the latter is more convincing in assessing environmental loading capacity. If the system boundaries of the two methods are expanded, in other words, factors such as ecosystem services, labor, and infrastructure construction are integrated into the upstream of the target system, and environmental impact is further analyzed using LCA in the downstream of the system, the two approaches would complete each other. The quantified results would be more objective. Therefore, these two theories have the necessity of coupling development. After reviewing recent coupling application cases, the results show that LCA and EMA have commonality in the upstream of the target system (mainly in inventory database construction), while the environmental impact assessment methods are different in the downstream. So the overall coupling analysis method is not formed. The current paper gives rational suggestions on the coupling development of the two systems in terms of the aggregate emergy flow table, the indicator system construction and indicator evaluation methods. In addition, it is necessary to introduce sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis in order to improve the reliability of assessment results. At present, the research on the coupling development of the two theories is in rapid development stage, but there are still many problems that need further exploration. © 2020 by the authors.",10.3390/su12010367,Literature on Life Cycle Assesment
ref_193,Use of optimization tools for decision-making: Accounting for externalities in the production of biobased plastics,"Plastic is one of the most versatile materials, but its production relies on fossil-based resources that have been linked to the increase in GHG emissions. In this sense, biobased plastics arise as an alternative to completely or partly substitute these fossil-based plastics. Nevertheless, it is still unclear if the use of biomass for the production of bioplastics can mitigate the environmental impact of fossil-based plastics and simultaneously provide economic benefits. The proper design of biomass supply chains plays an important role in the development of biobased plastics; however, economic criteria (e.g., maximization of revenues) is the most used parameter to optimize the supply chain, whereas environmental criteria are barely considered. For this purpose, we propose an optimization model that evaluates different supply chain configurations for the production of biobased polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using sugar beet and wheat. The optimization model accounts for the production costs and environmental costs through different methodologies, such as the Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), respectively. We found that the production of biobased terephthalic acid (TPA) directly influences the economic profitability of 100% biobased PET. The selection of feedstock and carbon tax scenario play an important role in the development of biobased supply chains. © 2020, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

ref_195,Human health and ocean pollution,"Background: Pollution – unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human activity – is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources – coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children’s risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals – phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste – can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South – environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth’s resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries.

ref_212,"Environmental regulation, governance, and policy instruments, 20 years after the stick, carrot, and sermon typology","In 1998, Evert Vedung posited a typology of policy instruments making governing akin to a conversation with a donkey: regulatory (sticks), economic (carrots) and information-based (sermons) instruments. Kathryn Harrison later applied this typology to pollution control in her popular ‘Talking with the Donkey’ piece. Though command-and-control instruments were central up until the late 1990s, growing global interest in ‘New Environmental Policy Instruments’ (NEPI) led to a disinterest in regulatory mechanisms and an increase in attention to information-based and economic instruments. Are governments using regulation as a policy instrument now more than before or are they choosing policy mixes? In this paper, I examine the state of the art regarding regulation as an environmental policy instrument by exploring whether the apparent shift to NEPI did reduce interest in environmental regulation as a policy instrument. I find that policy experiments with models of policy instruments led to increased interest in policy instrument mixes. Evidence from a systematic review of JEPP scholarship and a broader scholarly review of the literature on environmental policy instruments over the past 20 years focused on drinking water and solid waste governance suggest that policy mixes might work best when faced with conditions of uncertainty and governance complexity. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/1523908X.2020.1792862,environmental governance

ref_217,The Political Economy of (Un)Sustainable Production and Consumption: A Multidisciplinary Synthesis for Research and Action,"Despite widespread recognition of the need to transition toward more sustainable production and consumption and numerous initiatives to that end, global resource extraction and corresponding socio-ecological degradation continue to grow. Understanding the causes of this persistent failure is a necessary step towards more effective action. This article contributes to that understanding by synthesizing theory and evidence that links unsustainable production-consumption systems to power and inequality. While sustainable consumption and production research and action mostly focuses on technological or behavioral change, the socio-ecological inequalities driving production-consumption systems built into the organization of our global political economy, remain largely overlooked. In response, we propose a structural political economy orientation that seeks explicitly to reduce these inequalities and advance environmental justice and, thus, create the conditions for sustainable production-consumption systems. We then propose three important arenas of research and action towards sustainable production-consumption systems: justice, governance, and co-production of knowledge and action. These arenas, collectively and individually, can serve as entry points to study and act on the dynamics of (un)sustainable production-consumption systems. This can be done at the micro level, with respect to specific commodity chains or systems of provisioning, or at meso and macro levels with respect to national and global production networks. Our proposed orientation helps distinguish research and practice proposals into those emphasizing management and compensation resulting often in persistence of unsustainability, from those proffering structural changes in unsustainable production-consumption systems. We invite critique and collaboration to develop this research and action agenda further. © 2020",10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105265,"Sustainable consumption

ref_218,Appropriation of sustainability priorities to gain strategic advantage in a supply chain,"Purpose: The authors develop a methodology to select appropriate sustainable supply chain indicators (SSCIs) to measure Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the global supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: SSCIs are identified by reviewing the extant literature and topic modeling. Further, they are evaluated based on existing SDGs and ranked using the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Notably, the evaluation of indicators is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process within a fuzzy environment. The methodology has been explained using a case study from the automobile industry. Findings: The case study identifies appropriate SSCIs and differentiates them among peer suppliers for gaining a competitive advantage. The results reveal that top-ranked sustainability indicators include the management of natural resources, energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and social investment. Practical implications: The study outcome will enable suppliers, specialists and decision makers to understand the criteria that improve supply chain sustainability in the automobile industry. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the competitive package of indicators for gaining strategic advantage. This proactive sustainability indicator selection promotes and enhances sustainability reporting while fulfilling regulatory requirements and increasing collaboration potential with trustworthy downstream partners. This study sets the stage for further research in SSCIs’ competitive strategy in the automobile industry along with its supply chains. Originality/value: This study is unique as it provides a framework for determining relevant SSCIs, which can be distinguished from peer suppliers, while also matching economic, environmental and social metrics to achieve a competitive advantage. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/IJPPM-06-2020-0298,Para Pavlo
ref_220,The hierarchy of resource use for a sustainable circular economy,"Purpose: The original principles of the hierarchy of resource use seem to have been forgotten. The purpose of this paper is to address the necessity of these principles in order for a circular economy (CE) to be sustainable. Design/methodology/approach: This is a general review paper explaining today’s shortcomings in a CE and in the waste hierarchy. Its theoretical contribution is illustrated using the example of marine plastic waste in the Arctic, as well as the EU’s action plan for a CE: “Closing the loop”. Findings: There is a need to reduce raw materials into the economy directly and not only as a potential result of recycling. This is supported theoretically and by illustrating that the EU’s action plan is closing the loop primarily from the output side. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical possibility of complete recycling rests on a premise that is now at odds with a sustainable development. Social implications: The power of existing raw material production cycles must be challenged to allow reduction to be a real option. If not, a CE may exacerbate a moral trade-off by the current generation reducing the safe operating space of future living beings. Originality/value: The theoretical possibility of recycling everything, also known as the technology-optimist view, has played the role of a safety net for humanity. As we are now exceeding planetary boundaries for a safe and just space for humanity, this theoretical safety net is no longer valid. Instead, we must reinforce the basic principles of the hierarchy of resource use. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/IJSE-02-2019-0103,Circular Econmy
ref_221,"Towards a circular economy: Using stakeholder subjectivity to identify priorities, consensus, and conflict in the Irish EPS/XPS market","In European Seas, plastic litter from fishing activities, river transport, and poor waste management is one of the fastest growing threats to the health of the marine environment. Extruded polystyrene (XPS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS), specifically, have become some of the most prominent types of marine litter found around Europe's coastlines. To combat this problem, the European Commission has ratified a series of regulations and policies, including the Single-Use Plastics Directive and the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy. However, in order to ensure that the benefits of such regulations and policies are realized at a scale that can adequately address the scope of the problem, decision-makers will need to integrate the opinions, values, and priorities of relevant stakeholders who operate across the EPS/XPS product lifecycle. In this study, we apply a 35-statement Q-methodology to identify the priorities of stakeholders as they relate to the Irish EPS/XPS market and the wider societal transition to a circular economy. Based on the responses of nineteen individuals representing industry, policy-makers, and community leaders, we identified three distinct perspectives: System Overhaul; Incremental Upgrade; and Market Innovation. The results demonstrate that the type and format of policy interventions linked to Ireland's EPS/XPS circular economy are heavily contested, which presents significant challenges for driving the debate forward. These results provide valuable information on viewpoints that can be used by different stakeholders at national and EU levels to address areas of conflict, ultimately fostering the development of more effective, broadly supported co-developed policies. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/su11236834,Maybe for Alexis?
ref_222,The Potential of Industrial Symbiosis: Case Analysis and Main Drivers and Barriers to Its Implementation,"Industrial symbiosis, which is characterised mainly by the reuse of waste from one company as raw material by another, has been applied worldwide with recognised environmental, economic, and social benefits. However, the potential for industrial symbiosis is not exhausted in existing cases, and there is still a wide range of opportunities for its application. Through a comprehensive literature review, this article aims to compile and analyse studies that focus on potential industrial symbiosis in real contexts, to highlight the margin of optimisation that is not being used. The cases reported in the publications identified here were characterised and analysed according to geographic location, type of economic activity, waste/by-products, main benefits, and the methods employed in the studies. From this analysis, we conclude that there is great potential for applications involving industrial symbiosis throughout the world, and especially in Europe, corresponding to 53% of the total cases analysed. Manufacturing stood out as the sector with the highest potential for establishing symbiosis relationships, and the most common types of waste streams in potential networks were organic, plastic and rubber, wood, and metallic materials. This article also discusses the main drivers and barriers to realising the potential of industrial symbiosis. The diversity of industries, geographical proximity, facilitating entities and legislation, plans, and policies are shown to be the main drivers. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/su11247095,industrial symbiosis
ref_225,Circular economy and the matter of integrated resources,"A circular economy offers solutions for global sustainability challenges through the transition from the linear take-make-use-dispose economy to a better organisation of resources. However, realising a circular economy has ran into various biophysical constraints. Circular economy implementation is shaped by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's butterfly diagram that depicts ‘biological’ and ‘technical’ flows as separate cycles, subsequently interpreted as organic materials circulating in open loop systems via the environment and inorganic materials circulating in closed loop systems within society. Conversely, in our view, resource flows often contain tightly bound combinations of organic and inorganic materials either due to their natural composition or due to their technical design. Building on this observation, a new diagram is proposed that broadens the scope of the circular economy to cover extractive sectors and the return of materials from anthropogenic use to natural reserves, thereby reshaping the conceptual space within which solutions such as effective zero-waste-residue technologies, business models, and policies can be developed for the optimal management of integrated resources from a whole-system perspective. The diagram offers a realistic outlook on the biophysical limitations of circularity and endeavours to inspire discussion that supports the transition towards a sustainable circular economy. © 2019",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.449,NA
ref_227,Evaluating circular economy under a multi-parametric approach: A technological review,"A circular economy (CE) is conceptualized under different rounds of materials and energy cycling flows and is a matter of a three-level deployment: inter-enterprise circulation, regional circulation, and social circulation. Regarding them, the aim of this research was to get an update on the current technological advances and the perspectives of its implementation. Thus, a multi-parametric approach has been conducted to analyze the functionality of technologies in wastewater treatment, organic waste management, agrarian development, and food waste in the context of CE. Beside the narrative of the technological view, a critical approach assimilates the environmental, marketing, economic, governmental, and procedural viewpoints and leads to key indicators which are subject to positive and negative externalities. Due to this co-existence, we denoted the complexity of CE principle implementation and the need for specific envisage in each case, while proposing strategies are formulated in the light of social-environmental impact. Finally, further research gaps were proposed for deeper consideration. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/su11216139,Circular economy aspects
ref_229,Life cycle assessment and the willingness to pay of waste polyester recycling,"As an important approach to recover solid waste, the recycling of waste polyester has drawn a growing level of public concern. This study aims to investigate the life cycle assessment and social cost of life cycle assessment of waste polyester recycling. The results show that the polyester recycling process itself has significant environmental impact on global warming, fossil resource scarcity, human carcinogenic toxicity, water consumption and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Global warming, terrestrial ecotoxicity and land use are the most influential categories of social cost of life cycle assessment, with a contribution of 55.7%, 10.9% and 6.3% respectively. Through key process identification, sensitivity analysis and integrated evaluation study, it is found that electricity generation, direct air emissions and transportation are key processes that affect social cost of life cycle assessment and life cycle assessment. The effects of these key processes on social cost of life cycle assessment are greater than that on life cycle assessment. Consequently, the corresponding optimization measures are proposed in order to improve the sustainability performance of polyester industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.123,Environmental impact of Recycling
ref_232,Landfill impacts on the environment— review,"Waste management (WM) is a demanding undertaking in all countries, with important implications for human health, environmental preservation, sustainability and circular economy. The method of sanitary landfilling for final disposal of waste remains a generally accepted and used method but the available scientific evidence on the waste-related environmental and health effects is not conclusive. Comparative studies of various WM methods (landfilling, incineration, composting etc.) show that among the municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment and disposal technological options, sanitary landfilling or open dumping is popular in most countries because of the relative low cost and low-technical requirement. The European Union (EU) Directive on waste landfills has introduced specific goals for reducing the volume of disposed waste and very strict requirements for landfilling and landfill sites. Evaluation of the impact of landfills on the environment is a crucial topic in the literature and has received increased attention recently, given growing environmental concerns. The main goal of this survey was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of possible impacts of MSW landfills on the environment. The main conclusion of the overall assessment of the literature is that the disposal of MSW in landfills entails a number of environmental risks but with respect to the current situation and rich style of living adopted in industrially developed countries, the idea of WM systems functioning without landfilling—at least in the foreseeable future within one generation—seems to be somewhat unreal. The results also provided important information of landfills as a source of environmental risk. Results of this research may have an important impact on landfill management and the disposal of waste. From the literature review, it is evident that even if high levels of waste avoidance, reuse and recycling are achieved, some waste materials will always need to be forwarded for disposal. © 2019 by the author.

ref_233,Circular cities,"A circular approach to the way in which we manage the resources consumed and produced in cities – materials, energy, water and land – will significantly reduce the consumption of finite resources globally. It will also help to address urban problems including resource security, waste disposal, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, heating, drought and flooding. Taking a circular approach can also tackle many other socio-economic problems afflicting cities, for example, providing access to affordable accommodation, expanding and diversifying the economic base, building more engaged and collaborative communities in cities. Thus it has great potential to improve our urban living environments. To date, the industrial ecologists and economists have tended to dominate the circularity debate, focusing on closed-loop industrial systems and circular economy (circular businesses and systems of provision). In this paper I investigate why the current state-of-the-art conceptualisation for circular economy (RESOLVE) is inadequate when applied to a city. Through this critique and a broader review of the literature I identify the principles and components which are lacking from the circular economy (CE) conceptualisation when applied to a city. I then use this to develop my own definition and conceptualisation of a circular approach to urban resource management. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.",10.1177/0042098018806133,NA

Both the resource recovery and occupational science literature were reviewed and analyzed. However, despite the current lack on studies on how migrants' transition into waste sorting schemes at the household level, this scoping review was able to provide a broad picture of the engagement in daily activities that support sustainability, such as household waste sorting. Given the current initiatives to develop efficient resource recovery from waste, such knowledge contributes to efforts to engage households with different cultures and experiences in waste sorting. The results highlight the importance of future research to better understand how people who are new to waste management schemes experience these, and study the way that engagement in waste sorting shifts and transforms.

ref_251,Ecosystem services of partial organic substitution for chemical fertilizer in a peri-urban zone in China,"Chemical nitrogen fertilizer application in the peri-urban zone has benefited food supply, but excess nitrogen input has altered multiple ecosystem services and caused an array of ecosystem dis-services that have degraded air and water quality. Using sewage sludge compost and pig manure to partially substitute chemical fertilizer nitrogen may promote sustainable ecosystem services. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the values of associate ecosystem services with a unified standard. To comprehensively understand the effect of partial organic substitution on ecosystem services (supporting vegetable production and sequestering soil organic carbon) and ecosystem dis-services (greenhouse gas emissions and reactive nitrogen release), we attempted to evaluate the ecosystem service from the perspective of economic assessment. A field experiment was conducted in a peri-urban zone in eastern China, including the following six treatments at equal total nitrogen application rates: (1) no fertilizer nitrogen applied; (2) 25% sewage sludge compost substitution; (3) 25% pig manure substitution; (4) 50% sewage sludge compost substitution; (5) 50% pig manure substitution and (6) chemical fertilizer nitrogen only. The results showed that partial organic substitution significantly increased annual vegetable yield by 27.8%–35.3% and annual soil organic carbon sequestration rate by 129.2%–213.8%. Moreover, greenhouse gas emissions (methane and nitrous oxide) were significantly decreased by 28.6%–43.2%; nitrogen leaching and runoff were significantly decreased by 39.0%–49.5% and 26.8%–62.0%, respectively; and ammonia volatilization was increased by 2.4%–27.8%. Overall, partial substitution with organic fertilizer decreased total reactive nitrogen losses by 19.9%–39.8% compared with the 100% chemical fertilizer nitrogen treatment. Although additional labor and higher input costs were required, partial organic substitution could obtain a higher net economic benefit of 25198–90670 ¥ ha −1 yr −1 compared with the sole application of chemical fertilizer nitrogen. The results suggest that partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer can sustain ecosystem services and reduce ecosystem dis-services in the peri-urban zone and increase economic profits for farmers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.03.201,Ecosystems services examples
ref_252,Biodiversity impact assessment of building's roofs based on Life Cycle Assessment methods,"To fight against the biodiversity loss and to take advantage of ecosystem services that nature can offer, urban planners integrate green spaces in urban projects. However to assess green spaces, attention is generally paid to local biodiversity (i.e. “in situ”)which concerns the plot on which buildings are constructed. The biodiversity impacted outside the construction site (i.e. “ex situ”)which concerns the extraction of materials, transportation and waste, is rarely associated to the project assessment. In this study, two endpoint Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)methods are applied: ReCiPe 2016 and Impact World + to assess a conventional roof and three different types of green roofs. As Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)data about urban plants are missing, we created new data to model the vegetation layer of green roofs by collecting information nearby plants nursery. This work shows that 1)extensive green roof generates the least biodiversity loss, 2)“ex situ” biodiversity is 10 times more impacted than “in situ” biodiversity, 3)the impact of the vegetation layer on the biodiversity loss is significant. LCA methods do not enable to cover all pressures threatening biodiversity and they also lack precision to assess “in situ” biodiversity. Nevertheless, their main strength is to consider “ex situ” biodiversity along the value chain of the studied systems. Coupling LCA with ecological expertise should improve the assessment by taking into account local specificities and both negative and positive impacts of a system (e.g. “in situ” biodiversity gains with green roofs). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.04.014,"Yes,

On the other hand, value recovery from e-waste offers significant economic benefits due to the valuable metals in e-waste, such as precious and base metals. Many developed countries have employed effective e-waste management strategies and state-of-art recycling technologies, such as integrated pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical smelters to manage this waste stream sustainably and extract the maximum value components from this secondary resource. This has not been the case in most of the developing countries and e-waste management is still in its infancy. The value recovery operations have been informal and semi-formal without incorporating required waste disposal strategies. Addressing this current socio-environmental issue, especially in developing countries, has been significant to achieve some of the United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11), responsible production and consumption (Goal 12), and life below water (Goal 14), by 2030 (The United Nations: Sustainable development goals, 2018).

ref_259,How much innovation is needed to protect the ocean from plastic contamination?,"Plastics are non-biodegradable, and increasing accumulation of plastic debris in the ocean is a major cause for concern. The World Economic Forum, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and McKinsey & Company claimed in 2016 that technological innovations can solve the plastic problem. Such a claim raises an as yet unanswered question: how much technological innovation is needed and is it economically feasible? We offer answers to this question via a system dynamics model that we developed to simulate different scenarios aimed at controlling plastic debris entering the global ocean. Our results show that ocean cleanup technologies could achieve a 25% reduction in the level of plastic debris in the ocean below 2010 levels in 2030. However, this would require removing 15% of the stock of plastic debris from the ocean every year over the period 2020–2030, which equates to 135 million tons of plastic in total (metric tons). The implementation cost of such an ocean cleanup effort would amount to €492 billion-€708 billion, which represents 0.7%–1.0% of the world GDP in 2017 – this calculation is based on unit costs in €/kg estimated in The Ocean Cleanup project feasibility study. The Ocean Cleanup project alone is designed to collect 70,320 tons of plastic debris over a 10 year period. Removing 135 million tons of plastic debris would require investing in 1924 similar cleanup projects. These results help to assess the economic feasibility of removing such large volume of plastics. Moreover, our results provide quantitative confirmation that technological solutions alone are not sufficient to solve plastic pollution issues. A portfolio of diverse solutions – not only technological ones – is likely to have greater technical, political and economic feasibility. Our model shows that such a combined portfolio implemented over the period 2020–2030 could reduce the ocean plastic stock to 2013 levels (94 million tons) by 2030. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.258,"Yes

As an important component of the biogeochemical cycle, carbon flows through various natural and artificial processes. Therefore, carbon can be used as a research vector to explore the relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being. This study proposed a method for a quantitative assessment of “ecosystem services-human well-being” based on carbon flows. The assessment of the changes in ecosystem services and human well-being based on carbon in the Manas River Basin from 1990 to 2015 revealed the complex relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being. The results were as follows: (1) The development of ecosystem services was uneven, with increasing provisioning services and decreasing regulating, supporting and cultural services. (2) The basic materials for a good life and health in human well-being showed an upward trend, and the security indicator showed a downward trend. (3) The indicators of the basic materials for a good life and health were significantly positively correlated with provisioning services and were significantly negatively correlated with the other three services. Moreover, the internal structure of the security and health indicators were malformed. (4) Over time, the impact of provisioning services on the well-being indicators has gradually weakened, and the influence of regulating, supporting and cultural services has continually increased. In general, this study evaluated the complex relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being through carbon flow quantification, which can not only unify the dimensions for comparison, but also eliminate the impact of subjective factors to achieve a scientific nature. It is not only helpful to provide theoretical and practical basis for scientific management of Manas River Basin, but also to explore a larger scale and a wider area in the world through selecting indicators according to local conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.100934,Exemple of ecosystem services?

Faced with limited environmental resources for food production, issues related to food loss and waste are critical in mitigating challenges stemming from projected population growth and long-term food security and sustainability. The potential for using insects to consume organic waste materials and convert them into feed for animal, biofuels, and other valuable secondary products is gaining momentum as both a research discipline and as a business opportunity. Here, this ecosystem service is referred to as “insects as bioconverters of organic waste.” Scientific reviews of this topic have mainly focused on the challenges associated with development of commercial scale systems. To compliment existing reviews, we address this exciting topic from an artificial selection perspective, as we review and discuss aspects associated with targeted breeding and adaptation of both gut microbial communities and host insects themselves. We describe the “ideal insect bioconverter,” insects uniquely equipped to convert wastes into biomass and other valuable secondary products, and we present the current knowledge and existing research gaps towards the development of such organisms. We conclude that (1) targeted breeding of insects and their gut microbes can produce tailored insect lineages for bioconversion of specific waste streams; (2) research is needed to take full advantage of the existing insect diversity to identify new candidate species for bioconversion; and (3) further research into insect-gut microbial complexes will likely provide important insight into ways insects can be used as sustainable bioconverters of highly specialized waste streams. © 2019, The Author(s).",10.1007/s13593-019-0577-z,"Maybe

ref_263,Gateway of landfilled plastic waste towards circular economy in Europe,"For decades, significant work has been conducted regarding plastic waste by dealing with rejected materials in waste masses through their accumulation, sorting and recycling. Important political and technical challenges are involved, especially with respect to landfilled waste. Plastic is popular and, notwithstanding decrease policies, it will remain a material widely used in most economic sectors. However, questions of plastic waste recycling in the contemporary world cannot be solved without knowing the material, which can be achieved by careful sampling, analysis and quantification. Plastic is heterogeneous, but usually all plastic waste is jointly handled for recycling and incineration. Separation before processing waste through the analytical approach must be applied. Modern landfill mining and site clean-up projects in contemporary waste management systems require comprehensive material studies ranging from the macro-characterization of waste masses to a more detailed analysis of hazardous constituents and properties from an energy calorific standpoint—where, among other methods, thermogravimetric research coupled with life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic assessment is highly welcomed. © 2019 by the authors.

The research method is based on a qualitative multiple case study carried out on four Italian companies operating in the luxury furniture industry. A worthy degree of awareness and knowledge of Circular Economy principles emerged from the analysis. Nevertheless, furniture companies analyzed are still little involved in Circular Economy practices, especially concerning reuse and recycle actions, which are particularly important within this perspective. Similarly, very little use of process and product certifications emerged from the study.

ref_272,Floating matter: a neglected component of the ecological integrity of rivers,"Floating matter (FM) is a pivotal, albeit neglected, element along river corridors contributing to their ecological integrity. FM consists of particulate matter of natural (e.g. wood, branches, leaves, seeds) and anthropogenic (e.g. plastic, human waste) origin as well as of organisms that, due to its properties, is able to float on the water surface. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the FM cycle and the fundamental environmental functions FM provides along rivers. Indeed, FM serves as an important geomorphological agent, a dispersal vector for animals and plant propagules, a habitat, a resource, and a biogeochemical component. Furthermore, we collected data on the amount of FM accumulating at dams and in reservoirs, and related it to key characteristics of the respective catchments. River fragmentation truncates the natural dynamics of FM through its extraction at damming structures, alteration in the flow regime, and low morphological complexity, which may decrease FM retention. Finally, we identify key knowledge gaps in relation to the role FM plays in supporting river integrity, and briefly discuss FM management strategies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s00027-019-0619-2,Plastic that goes to RIvesres?
ref_273,Ecosystem services impacts as part of building materials selection criteria,"The built environment is responsible for large negative ecological impacts due in part to the vast amount of materials used in construction. Concurrently, construction and demolition activities result in vast amounts of materials being buried, burnt, and dumped. It is essential therefore to analyze the impact of building materials acquisition, use, and transformation on the ecosystems people inhabit and rely upon for well-being. Typically, this is examined in terms of material use, energy use, and emission of pollutants including greenhouse gases. The impacts various materials have on complex and interconnected networks of ecosystem services are rarely considered. In light of this, this article introduces the concept of ecosystem services in relation to selecting materials for the construction of the built environment. A methodology for applying ecosystem services analysis to building materials specification is presented, and a series of example matrices that examine a selection of materials that are grown, extracted, or made are provided. The article concludes that the potential for positive change in terms of the ecological impact related to building materials across their lifecycles and in how built environments and the materials within them are designed, specified, valued, built, and used is apparent if an understanding of ecosystem services is integrated into built environment materials selection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.mtsust.2019.100010,Ejemplo de ecosystem services for design
ref_275,Resource control by introducing an environmental currency: Comparison of feedstock sources for polyethylene production,"The uncontrolled resource consumption of our time causes serious ecological and economic problems. The continuation of high consumption of fossil fuels triggers climate change, while important metal ore deposits may be depleted within the near future. This situation requires a new kind of solution. For this purpose, the Ecopoint concept is proposed for the limitation of the consumption of fossil fuels and abiotic other non-renewable resources, as well as the land used to produce renewable ones. In this concept, the world’s population is provided with resource shares (Ecopoints) that are used for purchasing products containing virgin resources. Using the polym-erization of high density polyethylene as an example, it is shown that the Ecopoints concept favours options like sugar-based biomass (sweet sorghum, sugarcane, sugar beet) as a feedstock for bioethanol derived ethylene and waste materials (waste plastic, municipal solid waste) as a feedstocks for ethylene derived from cracking or gasification/Fischer-Tropsch synthesis over the conventional use of fossil fuel derived ethylene. © 2018 Cisa Publisher.",10.31025/2611-4135/2019.13777,NA

ref_287,Circular cities: Challenges to implementing looping actions,"Currently cities consume 60-80% of natural resources globally. They produce 50% of global waste and 75% of green-house gas emissions. The UN estimates that 66% of the world's population will live in cities by 2050 while the global urban footprint will triple over the years to 2030. Thus cities, as a system of production and consumption, threaten the environmental sustainability of the globe. Looping actions-reuse, recycling and recovery of resources (materials, energy, water, land and infrastructure)-can help to address resource scarcity and wastage in cities. However, there are many challenges to implementation. Much of the literature explores the challenges to looping actions within resource sectors and for specific actions (i.e., challenges to adaptive reuse of buildings, recycling of material waste, energy recovery from sewage). It often does so without any clear reference to context. Nexus solutions are becoming a popular resource looping response to tackling wastage in cities. Some of the challenges to implementation have been explored, but influence of context has not been investigated. In this paper we explore the challenges facing the implementation of looping actions in cities. Using a mixed methods approach, we identify 58 challenges to looping actions across eight themes. We also establish the challenges to implementing a nexus solution. The research identifies five common implementation challenges. Addressing these challenges could enable looping actions across resource types in cities. The research also demonstrates how context affects the challenges to implementing looping actions and nexus solutions in cities. Nevertheless, the analysis suggests that there are some common levers for promoting looping actions and nexus solutions in cities, regardless of context. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/su11020423,NA
ref_288,A taxonomy of circular economy indicators,"Implementing circular economy (CE) principles is increasingly recommended as a convenient solution to meet the goals of sustainable development. New tools are required to support practitioners, decision-makers and policy-makers towards more CE practices, as well as to monitor the effects of CE adoption. Worldwide, academics, industrialists and politicians all agree on the need to use CE-related measuring instruments to manage this transition at different systemic levels. In this context, a wide range of circularity indicators (C-indicators) has been developed in recent years. Yet, as there is not one single definition of the CE concept, it is of the utmost importance to know what the available indicators measure in order to use them properly. Indeed, through a systematic literature review – considering both academic and grey literature – 55 sets of C-indicators, developed by scholars, consulting companies and governmental agencies, have been identified, encompassing different purposes, scopes, and potential usages. Inspired by existing taxonomies of eco-design tools and sustainability indicators, and in line with the CE characteristics, a classification of indicators aiming to assess, improve, monitor and communicate on the CE performance is proposed and discussed. In the developed taxonomy including 10 categories, C-indicators are differentiated regarding criteria such as the levels of CE implementation (e.g. micro, meso, macro), the CE loops (maintain, reuse, remanufacture, recycle), the performance (intrinsic, impacts), the perspective of circularity (actual, potential) they are taking into account, or their degree of transversality (generic, sector-specific). In addition, the database inventorying the 55 sets of C-indicators is linked to an Excel-based query tool to facilitate the selection of appropriate indicators according to the specific user's needs and requirements. This study enriches the literature by giving a first need-driven taxonomy of C-indicators, which is experienced on several use cases. It provides a synthesis and clarification to the emerging and must-needed research theme of C-indicators, and sheds some light on remaining key challenges like their effective uptake by industry. Eventually, limitations, improvement areas, as well as implications of the proposed taxonomy are intently addressed to guide future research on C-indicators and CE implementation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.014,Circular economy literature
ref_291,Composition of plastic waste discarded by households and its management approaches,"Among the emerging environmental issues within Sub-Saharan Africa is the haphazard disposal of plastic waste, some of which end up downstream in the marine environment leading to negative effects. Notably there have been cases of humpback whales getting entangled in 'ghost' fishing nets, and endangered turtles ingesting plastic wastes in Watamu beach in Kenya. The aim of the current study was to assess the composition and management of plastic waste discarded by households in Watamu ward. Stratified random sampling was used to collect data from households in four sub-locations within Watamu ward. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics (the Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher's Exact test). The composition of plastics usually discarded as waste by households in order of dominance were low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, high density polyethylene and polypropylene (FH=37.959, p = 0.000). From the results, only 0.7% of respondents recycled their plastic waste. The most preferred disposal method of household plastic waste was open dumpsites (61.4%) followed by burning (12.9%) and discards (6.4%). Majority of respondents (93.6%), re-use some plastic containers for food, water, and oil storage. There was a significant difference in terms of how the respondents re-used their plastic waste in the four sub-locations (FH=36.437, p=0.005). In conclusion, the current plastic waste disposal methods at Watamu are not environmentally friendly and recycling is still at a smaller scale despite its potential to generate income and clean the environment, and promote ecosystem services and human wellbeing. © 2019 GJESM.",10.22034/gjesm.2019.01.07,NA

It consists of a wide range of elements and compounds including both valuable and hazardous materials. E-waste can contaminate the environment and threaten human health through its improper recycling and disposal methods. Moreover, E-waste represents a significant potential source of valuable materials to make the recycling of this waste economically fascinating. This chapter presents an overview of E-waste treatment technologies including sanitary landfill and recycling of precious metals, nonmetal elements, plastics, and glasses. The recycling of E-waste has become a significant issue because of the strange growth in the production of E-waste and increased awareness among people regarding environmental protection. Consequently, the primitive treatment technologies cannot reach the future obligations of industry because of the potential risk of environmental contamination, high cost, and low efficiency. An effective utilization of the reusable resources is therefore a prerequisite for developing new technologies to treat E-waste. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A stakeholders’ perspective,"The European waste policy is focused on reducing the negative impact of waste, eliminating the unhealthy use of resources, and on better waste management. The aim of this paper is to analyse Romania’s waste management practices in the EU context. The research methodology is based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis. The descriptive data analysis reveals significant differences among EU countries in terms of the municipal waste generated and the recycling rate. The municipal waste generated registers decrease, whereas there are significant increases in terms of the recycling rates in the EU countries. The qualitative research is based on the analysis of structured interviews among stakeholders, relevant for the waste management in Romania. The information obtained based on interviews was processed using NVivo and the main findings are focused on recommendations for improving the waste management system. We have identified a lack of adequate public support in the waste field due to insufficient awareness programs, lack of operator’s obligation for separate waste sanitation, people’s discouragement to separate their household waste, and lack of bins to separate collection. The correction of identified weaknesses could lead to an improved waste management system, feasible only through an active involvement of stakeholders. © 2019 The Author(s).",10.3846/tede.2019.10295,"MUniciplas waste management using stakeholder perspective

ref_320,"E-waste in the international context – A review of trade flows, regulations, hazards, waste management strategies and technologies for value recovery","E-waste, or waste generated from electrical and electronic equipment, is considered as one of the fastest-growing waste categories, growing at a rate of 3–5% per year in the world. In 2016, 44.7 million tonnes of e-waste were generated in the world, which is equivalent to 6.1 kg for each person. E-waste is classified as a hazardous waste, but unlike other categories, e-waste also has significant potential for value recovery. As a result it is traded significantly between the developed and developing world, both as waste for disposal and as a resource for metal recovery. Only 20% of global e-waste in 2016 was properly recycled or disposed of, with the fate of the remaining 80% undocumented – likely to be dumped, traded or recycled under inferior conditions. This review paper provides an overview of the global e-waste resource and identifies the major challenges in the sector in terms of generation, global trade and waste management strategies. It lists the specific hazards associated with this type of waste that need to be taken into account in its management and includes a detailed overview of technologies employed or proposed for the recovery of value from e-waste. On the basis of this overview the paper identifies future directions for effective e-waste processing towards sustainable waste/resource management. It becomes clear that there is a strong divide between developed and developing countries with regard to this sector. While value recovery is practiced in centralised facilities employing advanced technologies in a highly regulated industrial environment in the developed world, in the developing world such recovery is practiced in a largely unregulated artisanal industry employing simplistic, labour intensive and environmentally hazardous approaches. Thus value is generated safely in the hi-tech environment of the developed world, whereas environmental burdens associated with exported waste and residual waste from simplistic processing remain largely in developing countries. It is argued that given the breadth of available technologies, a more systematic evaluation of the entire e-waste value chain needs to be conducted with a view to establishing integrated management of this resource (in terms of well-regulated value recovery and final residue disposal) at the appropriately local rather than global scale. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.wasman.2018.10.018,E-waste literature
ref_322,The myth and the reality of energy recovery from municipal solid waste,"Background: Any manner of development can be sustainable only if the waste generated by it is not allowed to accumulate but is fully reused/recycled/recovered. Among the strategies to attain this goal have been the attempts to recover energy from municipal solid waste (MSW). About 60% of MSW is carbonaceous, consisting of materials which can either be biodegraded into fuels like methane or incinerated, thereby generating utilizable energy. MSW also contains several components-like metallic scrap and glass pieces-which can be reused or recycled, thereby achieving energy conservation. Given these attributes, MSW appears to be a potential source of energy and resources. Indeed, this belief that MSW is usable if only we try sincerely enough to do so prompts most of us to keep generating much more MSW than is warranted. But how realizable really is the energy potential of MSW? What perils loom into view when we actually set out to utilize MSW as an energy source? The present study addresses these crucially important questions. Methods: The work is based on a critical content analysis of the prior art. Results: The generation of MSW has consistently outpaced the world's efforts to dispose of it cleanly, and the energy (and material) recovery from MSW is easier said than done. In most instances, what is technically feasible is economically unfeasible. And what is economically feasible-such as setting the waste on fire as is often done in developing countries-is exceedingly harmful to the environment and the human health. Measures such as sanitary landfilling and incineration create as many new problems as the old ones they solve. Moreover, despite the use of these less-than-adequate technologies, a major portion of MSW generated in the world lies untreated. Conclusions: As the MSW output is expected to double by 2025, this situation is only set to become worse. Rising tides of E-waste would compound the problem even further. Hence, enormous stress should be put on the reduction of MSW generation by controlling wanton consumerism and wastage, rather than continuing with it in the false hope that technology will soon provide a magical solution and eliminate the problem. © 2018 The Author(s).",10.1186/s13705-018-0175-y,Interesting of Municipal solid waste

In this study, comprehensive assessment methodologies for soil risk in industrial areas were developed. The comprehensive assessment covered ecological and human health risks of soil pollution, as well as vulnerability of different types of risk receptors. Comprehensive ecological risk assessment integrated potential ecological risk assessment and landscape vulnerability assessment. Comprehensive social risk assessment specialized human health risk assessment by introducing spatial distribution of population. A typical industrial area in China was studied, and the quantitative and spatial assessments of the comprehensive soil risk were presented. The results showed that the spatial distribution of soil comprehensive ecological and social risks differed. High-risk areas of soil comprehensive ecological risk in the study area were mainly farmlands and nature reserves. Inhabited areas and industrial zones were less affected by comprehensive ecological risk of soil. By contrast, the spatial distribution of soil comprehensive social risk and human activities showed a clear trend of convergence.

ref_329,Decay patterns of invasive plants and plastic trash in urban streams,"Urban streams are impacted by invasion of exotic riparian plants and the accumulation of plastic trash, which alter in-stream litter subsidies, and cause changes that cascade up the aquatic food web. The impacts of these factors on urban streams is poorly understood. We compared decay rates and invertebrate colonizers of 5 litter pack types in 4 urban streams in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada: Native Red alder (Alnus rubra) and Sitka willow (Salix sitchensis), invasive English ivy (Hedera sp.), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus) and plastic trash (i.e. Styrofoam (polystyrene (PS)), plastic bag (high-density polyethylene (HDPE)), and Mylar (polyethylene terephthalate (PET). We tested 4 hypotheses: 1) exotic ivy and blackberry leaves would decay more slowly than native leaves; 2) exotic ivy and blackberry leaves would attract fewer and less diverse stream invertebrates than native leaves; 3) plastic trash would decay more slowly than leaves; and, 4) plastic trash would attract fewer and less diverse stream invertebrates than leaves. We found no difference between the leaf litter decay rates, however plastic trash decayed more slowly than leaves. Trash decay rates were faster than reported in marine environments, suggesting that plastic trash removal should be a management priority. Stream invertebrates colonized all pack types equally. We observed significant differences in litter decay rates and invertebrate assemblage alpha and Shannon–Wiener diversities across the 4 streams - likely related to differences in stream-specific environmental attributes including flashiness, stream discharge, and biological decay. We conclude that site-specific decay forces supersede litter quality in Pacific Coast urban streams. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11252-018-0771-9,Plastic waste

In this study, we aim to provide more detailed knowledge about the size and characteristics of the potential value to be captured from the resources embedded in waste. In order to investigate circular economy potentials in a real-life context, we apply case study research. The case is a municipal waste management company collecting and managing household waste. A number of initiatives are employed to collect as much waste for reuse and recycling as possible. The waste fractions with the highest collection potential are identified as being cardboard, plastics, waste wood and items for reuse. The subsequent processes of preparing these waste types for reuse and recycling are analyzed in the perspective of circular economy value creation. The data include waste amounts, the company's economic accounting, interviews and observations. From the perspective of the municipal waste authority, the largest value creation potential (economically, socially and environmentally) lies in preparing waste for reuse. Secondly, cardboard for recycling has an economic value potential. The collection, preparation and sales of waste wood and plastics constitute an economic deficit and hold limited environmental and social value. The findings suggest that the current regulation of the waste sector does not sufficiently support a transition to circular economy. From a focus on cost-effectiveness, waste managers must additionally change their mindsets towards a focus on value creation and increase reuse related activities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.04.031,Justification of Green fablab
ref_335,Ecological criteria for comparing linear and circular economies,"In the present article, the main principles of the circular economy are outlined in contradistinction with the existing and traditional linear economic model. An econometric model describing the influence of the linear economy on the environment is presented. The environment is characterized by seven key processes: change in global temperature; emissions of greenhouse gases from industry to the environment; emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture to the environment; CO2 emissions into the environment; depletion of fresh water supplies; reduction of forest cover; and economic damage from climatological disasters. The model describing the impact of the traditional linear economy on the environment consists of seven interdependent econometric equations, each comprising an autoregressive distributed lag (ADL)-model. The proposed econometric model is used to analyze the environmental effects of the present linear economy. Methodological provisions for a transformational transition of the traditional linear economic model to the closed-loop systems, which also permit the impact of the closed-loop systems on the environment to be analyzed, are set out. Seven ecological indicators are proposed as criteria for comparing the traditional linear economy and the closed-loop systems.

ref_338,A theory on the future of the rebound effect in a resource-constrained world,"The paradox underlying the rebound effect is that, due to secondary effects, improvements in resource efficiency provide smaller reductions in the consumption of energy and/or material resources than are expected-or even an overall net increase in resource use. The rebound effect has played a role in economic growth and industrialization, yet it remains a problem for the task of reducing negative environmental impacts. This paper proposes that the size of the rebound effect, and the type of impacts it causes, may be affected by future changes in the system within which it arises. Four types of rebound effect are considered: economy-wide effects, transformational effects, frontier effects, and international rebound effects. A conceptual model of the historical role of the rebound effect in socio-technical systems, and the relationship of socio-technical systems with natural capital and human-created capital, provides a ""sandbox"" for testing ideas about the future. The model theory draws upon the concepts of natural capital, the Global Ecological Footprint, and the Great Acceleration. How the size of four types of the rebound effect might change in future, as supplies of resources from natural capital become more constrained, is discussed within three storylines. In the first storyline, natural capital declines but remains fairly stable; rebound is much decreased as resources are less available and efficiency is used up more in stabilizing supplies of goods and services. In the second storyline, growth continues without constraint amid regional rivalry; eventually there is a strong downturn in availability of resources and negative impacts on both society and natural capital. In the third storyline, impact caps are implemented for different types of resources; for some time, industry and society adapt by investing in low resource-use innovation and global cooperation on management of natural capital; once natural capital recovers and stabilizes, growth and consumption may increase along with the rebound effect, but staying within a Global Ecological Footprint of 1 Earth. The theory and model in this paper are intended to contribute to new thinking on the subject of the rebound effect. © 2018 Freeman.",10.3389/fenrg.2018.00081,Rebounding effect literature
ref_346,"The role of constructed wetlands in a new circular economy, resource oriented, and ecosystem services paradigm","Wastewater management is included in one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG 6 is dedicated to water and sanitation and sets out to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”. SDG 6 expands the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focus on drinking water and basic sanitation to now cover the entire water cycle, including the management of water, wastewater and ecosystem resources. A UN report in 2017 states that likely over 80% of the wastewater worldwide is still discharged without adequate treatment. In several countries the wastewater management is nowadays a norm, but still there are open discussions about the kind of approach to be adopted, i.e. centralisation vs. decentralisation. The choice of the adopted technologies is strictly linked to environmental performances and economical aspects; one of the possible causes for the still enormous amount of untreated wastewater discharged into the environment can be the low “willingness to pay” for this kind of service and therefore a great focus should be given to all the technologies that are able to lower the treatment costs still maintaining reliable and robust performances in the long term. When considering wastewater as a carrier of valuable primary chemicals that can be easily converted to marketable products (fertilisers, bio-plastics, soil conditioners, biofuels, etc.), and as well as a relevant source of “new water” to be used for specific purposes, wastewater and runoff management can be highlighted as one of the most exciting challenges and occasions for a sustainable development in the near future. The paper aims to clarify the future role of CWs in circular economy, resource-oriented, and ecosystem services approaches, which want to respond to sanitation worldwide and the future research needs. We give an overview on how the conventional wastewater treatment scheme (what we call “waste paradigm”) should move towards more sustainable water and biogeochemical cycles following the new resource-oriented, circular economy and ecosystem service views. On this basis, we review the potential application of CWs within this new, and needed, paradigm. Finally, a meta-analysis shows that the scientific community involved in CWs should put more effort in making CWs more suitable for these new tasks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.11.086,SE in action as example

They are small enough to be ingested by a wide range of organisms and at nano-scale, they may cross some biological barriers. However, our understanding of their ecological impact on the terrestrial environment is limited. Plastic particle loading in agroecosystems could be high due to inputs of some recycled organic waste and plastic film mulching, so it is vital that we develop a greater understanding of any potentially harmful or adverse impacts of these pollutants to agroecosystems. In this article, we discuss the sources of plastic particles in agroecosystems, the mechanisms, constraints and dynamic behaviour of plastic during aging on land, and explore the responses of soil organisms and plants at different levels of biological organisation to plastic particles of micro and nano-scale. Based on limited evidence at this point and understanding that the lack of evidence of ecological impact from microplastic and nanoplastic in agroecosystems does not equate to the evidence of absence, we propose considerations for addressing the gaps in knowledge so that we can adequately safeguard world food supply. © 2018",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.01.341,Micro and nano plastic porllution literature
ref_349,"On the way to ‘zero waste’ management: Recovery potential of elements, including rare earth elements, from fine fraction of waste","Existing schemes of solid waste handling have been improved implementing advanced systems for recovery and reuse of various materials. Nowadays, the ‘zero waste’ concept is becoming more topical through the reduction of disposed waste. Recovery of metals, nutrients and other materials that can be returned to the material cycles still remain as a challenge for future. Landfill mining (LFM) is one of the approaches that can deal with former dumpsites, and derived materials may become important for circular economy within the concept ‘beyond the zero waste’. Perspectives of material recovery can include recycling of critical industrial metals, including rare earth elements (REEs). The LFM projects performed in the Baltic Region along with a conventional source separation of iron-scrap, plastics etc. have shown that the potential of fine-grained fractions (including clay and colloidal matter) of excavated waste have considerably large amounts of potentially valuable metals and distinct REEs. In this paper analytical screening studies are discussed extending the understanding of element content in fine fraction of waste derived from excavated, separated and screened waste in a perspective of circular economy. Technological feasibility was evaluated by using modified sequential extraction technique where easy extractable amount of metals can be estimated. Results revealed that considerable concentrations of Mn (418–823 mg/kg), Ni (41–84 mg/kg), Co (10.7–19.3 mg/kg) and Cd (1.0–3.0 mg/kg) were detected in fine fraction (<10 mm) of waste sampled from Högbytorp landfill, while Cr (49–518 mg/kg) and Pb (30–264 mg/kg) were found in fine fraction (<10 mm) of waste from Torma landfill revealing wide heterogeneity of tested samples.

Soils in peri-urban ecosystems are identified with both urban and rural/natural ecosystems' structural and functional features, and are prone to being affected by urbanization pressures. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems provide essential life-support functions and ecosystem services for urban and rural residents, including food supply, water purification, water conservation, contamination interception, leisure and entertainment services, cultural services, and more. Under rapid urbanization, a large area of agricultural and natural landscapes are converted to urban landscapes. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems therefore tend to be significantly disturbed because of increasing human activities, which change the soil processes and reduce the quality and diversity of soil functions such as food production, pollution attenuation, hydrological cycling, and energy balance. The inherent conflicts between urbanization and soil security have been studied for a long time. As urbanization levels in peri-urban ecosystems have increased, soil security problems in peri-urban ecosystems have been a key issue in recent studies. This study reviews published literature concerning soil security in peri-urban ecosystems and aims to contribute to scientific understanding of the interrelations between soil security and urbanization. Statistical analysis showed that the number of published papers concerning peri-urban ecosystems rapidly increased after 2000, especially in the past 5 years. Many studies concerning soil security were focused on urbanization' s influence on soil processes in urban areas, including cropland loss, food production, climate change, and other processes linked with soils. However, only a limited number of studies that focused on peri-urban areas were found. The soil security problems in peri-urban ecosystem areas were often ignored by both rural and urban ecosystems research. In this review, the particularity and complexity of soil security in peri-urban ecosystems are discussed. In summary, we suggest that future peri-urban studies should focus on the following issues: (1) exploring comparative studies at a large scale under different urban sprawl modes, (2) exploring the tradeoff of ecosystem services in the framework of soil security in peri-urban ecosystems, and perspectives on current solutions for soil security in peri-urban ecosystems are proposed, (3) exploring the sources of contaminants in soil and their co-contamination in peri-urban ecosystems, and optimizing landscape patterns to promote soil security and ecosystem services, and (4) considering the sustainable development goals of peri-urban ecosystems and highlighting the multi-dimensional role of soil security in sustainable policy and management. Because soils in peri-urban ecosystems have their own unique set of socioeconomic and ecological features, soil security should be emphasized for understanding the environmental response to global urbanization. © 2018 Science Press.

ref_351,"Bio-based plastics - A review of environmental, social and economic impact assessments","Bio-based plastics show an evolving market and application range and therefore have become increasingly popular in research and economy. The limitation of fossil resources as well as linked environmental issues have led to the development of an innovative bioeconomy and also triggered the shift from fossil-based plastics to bio-based plastics. The original motivation for this study was to propose a comprehensive approach to calculate the sustainability performance of bio-based plastics on a global scale. To provide a calculative basis, a review on available data from life cycle assessment (LCA), social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) studies on bio-based plastics was carried out and showed limited availability of quantifiable results with regard to the social and economic performance of bio-based plastics. In environmental LCA, with the ISO-family and related documents, a group of harmonized standards and approaches does exist. However, missing practical and consented guidelines hamper the comparability of studies and the exploitability of data - not only within the bio-based plastic sector but also in comparison to the fossil-based counterparts. Therefore, a calculation for the global sustainability performance of bio-based plastics was merely conducted for the environmental impact category global warming potential. Taking the technical substitution potential of fossil-based with bio-based plastics as well as limitations in data availability into account the estimation was performed for a substitution of approximately two-thirds of the global plastic demand. The results show, that bio-based plastics could potentially save 241 to 316 Mio. t of CO2-eq. annually. Thereby this study gives a first outlook how bio-based plastics could contribute to a sustainable development, making benefits and drawbacks more tangible. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.014,Bio based plastics literature
ref_356,Supply chain management and the circular economy: towards the circular supply chain,"Circular modes of production, known as the circular economy, are welcomed in political and business circles to overcome the shortcomings of traditional linear operating models. This article presents preliminary propositions concerning implications for the development of what we term ‘circular supply chains’, defined here as the embodiment of circular economy principles within supply chain management. Our propositions are based on the following arguments: a shift from product ownership to leasing and access in supply chain relationships; the relevance of structural flexibility and start-ups in regional or local loops; open and closed material loops in technical and biological cycles; closer collaboration within and beyond immediate industry boundaries and public and private procurement in the service industry as a lever for the scaling up of circular business models. We discuss what these circular economy principles mean in terms of supply chain challenges and conclude with limitations and future research agenda. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/09537287.2018.1449244,Circular economy and supply chain
ref_361,Plasticulture changes soil invertebrate assemblages of strawberry fields and decreases diversity and soil microbial activity,"In agriculture, the use of plastic mulch (plasticulture) is globally increasing. Besides beneficial effects on crop yield and quality, possible adverse environmental effects associated with plastic mulch are currently under debate. Aside from the obvious disadvantages of substantial amounts of (micro)plastic waste, adverse effects on soil quality and biodiversity might be assumed. We compared the effect of plastic mulch and organic mulch (straw) systems in strawberry cultivation on soil invertebrates and biological activity in an observational field study in the Upper Rhine valley, Germany. Soil invertebrates were collected using pitfall traps and Berlese-Tullgren-funnels, earthworms by hand sorting. Soil biological activity was determined using bait-lamina sticks and the MicroResp™ system. Soil samples from test fields were analysed for physicochemical and microbial parameters. Despite minor effects on soil physicochemical parameters, our results showed that the mulch system had a significant effect on the community structure of soil invertebrates. In strawberry fields with plastic mulch we found a decreased taxonomic richness and taxonomic richness decreased with increasing soil temperature. About 50% of the analysed taxa had significantly lower abundances in plastic mulched fields compared to fields with organic mulch. No investigated taxon had a higher abundance in plastic mulched fields. Soil moisture was the most important environmental variable in explaining invertebrate abundances. The soil microbial activity was significantly lower in plastic mulched fields than in fields with organic mulch. Our results indicate that even little shifts in abiotic (e.g. temperature, water content) and biotic (e.g. food availability) conditions associated with the plastic mulch system can have strong effects on soil invertebrates and soil microbial activity. Hence, plastic mulch might pose a threat to soil biodiversity and related ecosystem functions in agroecosystems. We call for further studies analysing the influence of plasticulture, to better evaluate the long-term consequences on agrobiodiversity and soil quality as well as sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.11.025,NA
ref_362,Investigation of municipal solid waste (Msw) and industrial landfills as a potential source of secondary raw materials,"Many of the secondary raw materials (SRM) in landfills constitute valuable and scarce natural resources. It has already been recognised that the recovery of these elements is critical for the sustainability of a number of industries and SRM recovery from anthropogenic waste deposits represents a significant opportunity. In this study, the characterisation of the different waste fractions and the amount of SRM that can potentially be recovered from two landfill sites in Finland is presented. The first site was a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill site and it was specifically investigated for its metals, SRM, plastics, wood, paper, and cardboard content as well as its fine fraction (<20 mm). The second site was an industrial landfill site containing residual wastes from industrial processes including 1) aluminium salt slag from refining process of aluminium scrap and 2) shredding residues from automobiles, household appliances and other metals containing waste. This site was investigated for its metals and SRM recovery potential as well as its fine fraction. Results suggest that the fine fraction offers opportunities for metal (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and SRM extraction and recovery from both landfill site types while the chemical composition of the industrial waste landfill offered greater opporutinity as it was comparable to typical aluminium salt slags. Nevertheless, the concentrations of rare earth metals (REE) and other valuable elements were low even in comparison with the concentrations found in the Earth’s crust. Therefore mining landfill sites only for their metals or SRM content is not expected to be financially viable. However, other opportunities, such as waste-derived fuels from excavated materials especially at MSW landfill sites, still exists and fosters the application and feasibility of landfill mining. © 2018 Cisa Publisher.",10.26403/detritus/2018.3,NA
ref_365,A microbiological approach to the ecosystem services,"Man has always exploited the environment for securing human life and culture. This “tradition” is both embedded into our instincts as well as a mode of behavior and a learnt method of survival in our societies. However, alongside with the globalization of the economy, internationalization, industrialization and population growth, the consequences of the one-sided approach of the past have become unbearable for the environment. Consequently, in order to maintain life on earth in its current form, we should establish new thinking and modes of action. Therefore, the survival strategies for Mankind should inherently contain the strive for sustainability, as well as the tendency to avoid past mistakes, and to repair them instantaneously whenever possible. The agricultural tradition of different nations leans on the centuries old wisdom of human civilization in a good sense. For example, the East Asian agricultural societies have learnt to handle each piece of land in their possession in an individual manner, taking into account the local environmental conditions. These principles are now more and more unanimously accepted, at least in theory. Also, the industrial ecosystem needs to be functioning in the natural way, and in balance with the environment. This is a necessity in the reversion or prevention of any developing environmental catastrophes that could wait behind the corner. As the major vehicles for the circulation of matter, microbes are in a key position and provide means for finding the solutions to serve the global ecosystems. In the aftermath of a vast environmental crisis, namely the oil leakage from the “Deepwater Horizon” oil platform well in the Mexican Gulf in the year 2010, it was noticed that the dramatic consequences of the spill were mitigated and the worst scenario of destruction avoided thanks to the cleaning actions of the marine micro-organisms. This was a positive result both ecologically and in economic sense. It further encouraged the scientists to find and isolate microbial strains which could be used for such operations. Although the natural microflora compensated and mitigated the effects of the Deepwater Horizon accident surprisingly well in 2010, there have been observations and concerns about the long term effects of this ecocatastroph (Geggel, 2015). © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",NA,microbiological ecosystems services

ref_367,Emergy-based indicators to measure circularity: Promises and problems,"In the constant pursue of the sustainability of socio-industrial systems, the definition of useful, reliable and informative, and at the same time simple and transparent, indicators is an important step for the evaluation of the circularity of the assessed systems. In the circular economy (CE) context, scientific literature has already identified the lack of overarching indicators (social, urban, prevention-oriented, etc.), pointing out that mono-dimensional indicators are not able to grasp the complexity of the systemic, closed-loop, feedback features of CE. In this respect, Emergy accounting is one of the approaches that have been identified as holding the potential to capture both resource generation and product delivery dimensions and therefore to provide an enhanced systems' evaluation in a CE perspective. Because of Emergy's intrinsic definition and its calculation structure, Emergy-based indicators conceptually lend themselves very well to the evaluation and monitoring of circular processes. Additionally, Emergy has the unique feature of enabling the evaluation of systems that are not necessarily only technosphere systems, but also of technological systems which embed nature (techno-ecological systems). The present paper gives a perspective on a set of Emergy-based indicators that we have identified as suitable to evaluate circular systems, and outlines the different perspective compared to the circularity indicators defined in the ""Circularity Indicators Project"" launched by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. © 2019 Mineral and Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Carrier bags manufactured from non-biodegradable polymers constitute a large component of this litter. Because of their adverse impact on marine life, non-biodegradable bags have recently been replaced by biodegradable ones. However, growing evidence shows that these latter are not readily degradable in marine sediments and can alter benthic assemblages. The potential impact of biodegradable bags on seagrasses inhabiting sandy bottoms, which are the most widespread and productive ecosystems of the coastal zones, has been ignored. Mesocosm experiments were conducted to assess the effect of a commercialized biodegradable bag on a common seagrass species of the Mediterranean, Cymodocea nodosa, both at the level of individual plant (clonal growth) and of plant community (plant-plant relationships), under three culture regimes (plant alone, in combination with a neighbour of the same species or of the co-existing seagrass Zostera noltei) simulating different natural conditions (bare substrate, monospecific meadows or mixed meadows). The bag behaviour in marine sediment and sediment physical/chemical variables were also examined. After six months of sediment exposure, the bag retained considerable mass (85% initial weight) and reduced sediment pore-water oxygen concentration and pH. In the presence of bag, C. nodosa root spread and vegetative recruitment increased compared to controls, both intra- and interspecific interactions shifted from neutral to competitive, and the growth form changed from guerrilla (loosely arranged group of widely spaced ramets) to phalanx form (compact structure of closed spaced ramets) but only with Z. noltei. These findings suggest that biodegradable bags altering sediment geochemistry could promote the spatial segregation of seagrass clones and influence species coexistence. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.06.249,marine plastic
ref_379,Metrics for optimising the multi-dimensional value of resources recovered from waste in a circular economy: A critical review,"Established assessment methods focusing on resource recovery from waste within a circular economy context consider few or even a single domain/s of value, i.e. environmental, economic, social and technical domains. This partial approach often delivers misleading messages for policy- and decision-makers. It fails to accurately represent systems complexity, and obscures impacts, trade-offs and problem shifting that resource recovery processes or systems intended to promote circular economy may cause. Here, we challenge such partial approaches by critically reviewing the existing suite of environmental, economic, social and technical metrics that have been regularly observed and used in waste management and resource recovery systems' assessment studies, upstream and downstream of the point where waste is generated. We assess the potential of those metrics to evaluate ‘complex value’ of materials, components and products, i.e., the holistic sum of their environmental, economic, social and technical benefits and impacts across the system. Findings suggest that the way resource recovery systems are assessed and evaluated require simplicity, yet must retain a suitable minimum level of detail across all domains of value, which is pivotal for enabling sound decision-making processes. Criteria for defining a suitable set of metrics for assessing resource recovery from waste require them to be simple, transparent and easy to measure, and be both system- and stakeholder-specific. Future developments must focus on providing a framework for the selection of metrics that accurately describe (or at least reliably proxy for) benefits and impacts across all domains of value, enabling effective and transparent analysis of resource recovery form waste in circular economy systems. © 2017 The Authors",10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.100,"Yes

ref_381,Environmental performances of different configurations of a material recovery facility in a life cycle perspective,"The study evaluated the environmental performances of an integrated material recovery facility (MRF) able to treat 32 kt/y of unsorted mixed waste, made of residuals from household source separation and separate collection. The facility includes a mechanical sorting platform for the production of a solid recovered fuel (SRF) utilized in an external waste-to-energy plant, bio-cells for tunnel composting of organic fraction, and a sanitary landfill for the safe disposal of ultimate waste. All the MRF sub-units have been analysed in depth in order to acquire reliable data for a life cycle assessment study, focused on the environmental performances of different configurations of the facility. The study investigated a “past” configuration, including just mechanical sorting, landfilling and biogas combustion in a gas engine, and the “present” one, which includes also a composting unit. Two possible “future” configurations, having a gasifier inside the MRF battery limits, have been also analysed, assessing the performances of two fluidized bed reactors of different size, able to gasify only the residues generated by the sorting platform or the whole amount of produced SRF, respectively. The analysis evaluated the contributions of each unit in the different configurations and allowed a reliable assessment of the technological evolution of the facility. The results quantified the positive effect of the inclusion of an aerobic treatment of the waste organic fraction. The SRF gasification in situ appears to improve the MRF environmental performances in all the impact categories, with the exclusion of that of global warming. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.039,"Maybe

ref_386,Material Services with both eyes wide open,"Energy has been at the forefront of the sustainable development discourse for quite some time as policymakers, industry heads and society at large have taken progressive steps to cut carbon via renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency measures. Unfortunately, some of these methods have given rise to perverse socio-environmental effects; as materials have been unnecessarily sacrificed, mines and wells have opened and plantations grown, in the name of energy saving. This paper contributes to clean energy-orientated policies and practices by exploring the discipline of sustainable materials. We first review two strategies: energy efficiency linked to materials; and material efficiency, meaning ""doing more with less."" We find that, although both contribute significantly, they are hampered by the rebound effect and their focus on ""doing less bad"" rather than ""good"". Furthermore, they do not in themselves evaluate the services and societal wellbeing that materials provide. We then define ""material services"" and propose a wider strategy that encompasses and enhances the previous two. Under the new strategy, we argue that sustainable materials should be considered as those that do no harm and which optimally, through the services provided, contribute to better sustainable development policies and practices. © 2017 by the authors.",10.3390/su9091508,NA
ref_389,Restoring soil and water resources and mitigating climate change in India by judicious management of agricultural and urban wastes,"India’s present population of 1.34 billion is increasing at the rate of 1.18% yr-1. India’s food grain production of 273.4 million tonnes (Mt) in 2017 has to be increased from lesser arable land area, lower fertilizer use and reduced consumption of water for supplementary irrigation. Furthermore, degraded soils, affecting land area of 114.2 million hectare (Mha), must be restored and risks of any new soil degradation minimized. In this context, the importance of recycling bio-wastes (e.g., agricultural, municipal and industrial) to restore soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration and stock and improve soil health cannot be over-emphasized. Crop residues, 510-836 Tg yr-1. are a major source of C, plant nutrients, biofuels and industrial raw materials. Rather than in-field burning and used as traditional fuel, composting and using as mulch can reduce risks of erosion and improve soil health. Similarly, dung production in India, also a rich source of C and nutrients, must be recycled as manure and used in bioreactors to produce methane. Wasted grains, fruits and vegetables must also be composted and used as a soil amendments. Judicious use of bio-wastes can re-carbonize the biosphere, restore degraded soils and improve soil health, produce biofuels and other value addition industrial byproducts, and improve the environment.

We review principles of social cognition and decision making that shape and constrain how environmental governance systems adapt. We focus primarily on the interplay between key decision makers in society and legal systems. We argue that adaptive governance must overcome three cooperative dilemmas to facilitate adaptation: (1) encouraging collaborative problem solving, (2) garnering social acceptance and commitment, and (3) cultivating a culture of trust and tolerance for change and uncertainty. However, to do so governance systems must cope with biases in people’s decision making that cloud their judgment and create conflict. These systems must also satisfy people’s fundamental needs for self-determination, fairness, and security, ensuring that changes to environmental governance are perceived as legitimate, trustworthy, and acceptable. We discuss the implications of these principles for common governance solutions (e.g., public participation, enforcement) and conclude with methodological recommendations. We outline how scholars can investigate the social cognitive principles involved in cases of adaptive governance. © 2017 by the author(s).",10.5751/ES-09154-220133,NA

ref_422,Externalities: why environmental sociology should bring them in,"The concept of externalities represents the core of environmental economics but appears much less in sociology and other social sciences. This article presents the concept of externalities and makes a case for its usefulness, noting reasons why environmental sociologists should like it and use it more than they do currently. The concept is closely tied to theories–of why environmental problems occur and how they can be addressed–which contradict influential perspectives in environmental sociology. But an externalities-centred approach to environmental issues is nonetheless highly sociological and consistent with current research in other subfields. From an externalities perspective, environmental problems and protection are intrinsically social, and often highly political, rooted in relations of injustice and/or distrust. Practically, the most promising solutions to environmental problems embody a balance of market liberalism and strong state regulation. Externalities should therefore be a constructively unifying concept for environmental research across the social sciences. The concept is also provocative; however, in that its diagnosis of environmental problems amounts to powerful advocacy for major policy changes–even if within capitalism and given continued economic growth. © 2016, © 2016 The Author(s).

Methods: A cradle-to-grave LCA in compliance with ISO standards 14040 and 14044 for the European market (EU27 + 2) was performed. The study was accompanied by a critical review process. The choice of the analysed packaging systems was made according to the European market share. Relevant processes were modelled with primary input data wherever possible; otherwise, average data from public LCI databases were applied. A wide range of environmental impact categories were covered: Climate Change, Ozone Depletion Potential, Summer Smog, Acidification, Eutrophication, Human Toxicity: PM10 and Abiotic Resource Depletion. To comply with ISO standards, a sensitivity analysis on allocation was performed. In addition, sensitivity analyses on recycling rates were included. Results and discussion: The primary environmental impacts for both food cartons arose from base material production for primary packaging. The environmental performance of the food cartons compared favourably with all competing systems for virtually all examined impact categories, primarily due to the fact that primary packaging materials for food cartons are derived from renewable resources. The additional sensitivity analyses quantifying the influence of end-of-life management did not change overall results yet revealed trajectories that could be indicative of trends in a range of different settings from no to complete recycling. Thus, the additional sensitivity analyses revealed a robust result that may be informative in circumstances that depart from European settings. Conclusions: Both food cartons show a superior performance in comparison with alternatives. The sensitivity analyses on recycling rates confirm this result even with very low or high quotas applied. These analyses provide valuable information on how different parameters depending on different geographic scopes may influence the overall results. Future LCA work would benefit from low-effort additional sensitivity analyses to broaden applicability of results and examine the robustness of findings. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s11367-016-1094-9,Sensitivity tool for LCA?
ref_427,Towards successful environmental performance of sustainable cities: Intervening sectors. A review,"Cities contribute around 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. There is currently a massive growth in urban areas internationally, especially in developing countries. Urban centers and cities should offer an effective answer to new problems arising from planning and expansion, according to criteria of sustainability. Decisions for sustainable cities planning and management should be taken on an evaluation of their consequences. Correspondingly, each strategy should be designed and undertaken with the right tools of study, analysis and prediction. This paper aims to offer an analysis of the aspects involved in designing sustainable cities. It involves an overview of published papers focusing on urban transport, building energy consumption, green areas planning, waste management and water supply on a city-wide scale. In order to give a broader concept of sustainability in cities, an analysis of other variables from a social point of view is also given. The discussion of this research reflects that the adoption of mechanisms to promote sustainable development is a matter not only of decision makers and designers, but also of users and citizens. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ref_429,Plastic mulching in agriculture. Trading short-term agronomic benefits for long-term soil degradation?,"Plastic mulching has become a globally applied agricultural practice for its instant economic benefits such as higher yields, earlier harvests, improved fruit quality and increased water-use efficiency. However, knowledge of the sustainability of plastic mulching remains vague in terms of both an environmental and agronomic perspective. This review critically discusses the current understanding of the environmental impact of plastic mulch use by linking knowledge of agricultural benefits and research on the life cycle of plastic mulches with direct and indirect implications for long-term soil quality and ecosystem services. Adverse effects may arise from plastic additives, enhanced pesticide runoff and plastic residues likely to fragment into microplastics but remaining chemically intact and accumulating in soil where they can successively sorb agrochemicals. The quantification of microplastics in soil remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate analytical techniques. The cost and effort of recovering and recycling used mulching films may offset the aforementioned benefits in the long term. However, comparative and long-term agronomic assessments have not yet been conducted. Furthermore, plastic mulches have the potential to alter soil quality by shifting the edaphic biocoenosis (e.g. towards mycotoxigenic fungi), accelerate C/N metabolism eventually depleting soil organic matter stocks, increase soil water repellency and favour the release of greenhouse gases. A substantial process understanding of the interactions between the soil microclimate, water supply and biological activity under plastic mulches is still lacking but required to estimate potential risks for long-term soil quality. Currently, farmers mostly base their decision to apply plastic mulches rather on expected short-term benefits than on the consideration of long-term consequences. Future interdisciplinary research should therefore gain a deeper understanding of the incentives for farmers and public perception from both a psychological and economic perspective in order to develop new support strategies for the transition into a more environment-friendly food production. © 2016 .",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.153,Acolchado de plastico y servicios ecosistemicos.
ref_437,Life-Cycle Assessment of Food-Packaging Systems,"Food packaging plays a fundamental role in today’s society because it protects food from external sources of contamination and preserves food properties during the entire assigned shelf life. Due to this fundamental role, its use is increasingly widespread including emerging or underdeveloped countries. The global amount of packaging materials manufactured and disposed of every day has led many researchers to deal with the issue of their environmental impact. Several studies have been performed starting from 1990 to the present that have been aimed at demonstrating the best type of use of and end of life for each type of food-packaging material. In recent years, some studies have also demonstrated how the extension of the food shelf life by means of improved packaging could decrease the environmental impact of an entire packaged food based mainly on the reduction of the associated food waste. Based on these premises, this chapter aims at reviewing the main articles in the field of environmental assessment of food packaging by means of a life-cycle assessment approach and showing how, during the last two decades, this issue has received increasing attention. The review was performed by analysing 172 scientific papers collected from the Scopus database using specific keywords and refining the results based on a detailed analysis of the content of each article. The results show how interest in this topic has grown consistently during the last 25 years and indicates several research lines available for further studies in this field. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.",10.1007/978-981-287-913-4_1,NA
ref_441,Time is an affliction: Why ecology cannot be as predictive as physics and why it needs time series,"Ecological systems depend on both constraints and historical contingencies, both of which shape their present observable system state. In contrast to ahistorical systems, which are governed solely by constraints (i.e. laws), historical systems and their dynamics can be understood only if properly described, in the course of time. Describing these dynamics and understanding long-term variability can be seen as the mission of long time series measuring not only simple abiotic features but also complex biological variables, such as species diversity and abundances, allowing deep insights in the functioning of food webs and ecosystems in general. Long time-series are irreplaceable for understanding change, and crucially inherent system variability and thus envisaging future scenarios. This notwithstanding current policies in funding and evaluating scientific research discourage the maintenance of long term series, despite a clear need for long-term strategies to cope with climate change. Time series are crucial for a pursuit of the much invoked Ecosystem Approach and to the passage from simple monitoring programs of large-scale and long-term Earth observatories - thus promoting a better understanding of the causes and effects of change in ecosystems. The few ongoing long time series in European waters must be integrated and networked so as to facilitate the formation of nodes of a series of observatories which, together, should allow the long-term management of the features and characteristics of European waters. Human capacity building in this region of expertise and a stronger societal involvement are also urgently needed, since the expertise in recognizing and describing species and therefore recording them reliably in the context of time series is rapidly vanishing from the European Scientific community. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.seares.2014.07.008,Maybe ? pero no creo
ref_443,A new regime of carbon counting: The practices and politics of accounting for everyday carbon through CO2e,"Inspired by the commercial desires of global brands and retailers to access the lucrative green consumer market, carbon is increasingly being counted and made knowable at the mundane sites of everyday production and consumption, from the carbon footprint of a plastic kitchen fork to that of an online bank account. Despite the challenges of counting and making commensurable the global warming impact of a myriad of biophysical and societal activities, this desire to communicate a product or service's carbon footprint has sparked complicated carbon calculative practices and enrolled actors at literally every node of multi-scaled and vastly complex global supply chains. Against this landscape, this paper critically analyzes the counting practices that create the 'e' in 'CO2e'. It is shown that, central to these practices are a series of tools, models and databases which, in building upon previous work (Eden, 2012; Star and Griesemer, 1989) we conceptualize here as 'boundary objects'. By enrolling everyday actors from farmers to consumers, these objects abstract and stabilize greenhouse gas emissions from their messy material and social contexts into units of CO2e which can then be translated along a product's supply chain, thereby establishing a new currency of 'everyday supply chain carbon'. However, in making all greenhouse gas-related practices commensurable and in enrolling and stabilizing the transfer of information between multiple actors these objects oversee a process of simplification reliant upon, and subject to, a multiplicity of approximations, assumptions, errors, discrepancies and/or omissions. Further the outcomes of these tools are subject to the politicized and commercial agendas of the worlds they attempt to link, with each boundary actor inscribing different meanings to a product's carbon footprint in accordance with their specific subjectivities, commercial desires and epistemic framings. It is therefore shown that how a boundary object transforms greenhouse gas emissions into units of CO2e, is the outcome of distinct ideologies regarding 'what' a product's carbon footprint is and how it should be made legible. These politicized decisions, in turn, inform specific reduction activities and ultimately advance distinct, specific and increasingly durable transition pathways to a low carbon society. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.04.011,Boundary objects theory?
ref_448,Measuring welfare beyond economics: The genuine progress of Hong Kong and Singapore,"Dissatisfaction with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as an indicator of a country's development or a population's wellbeing led to the development of the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). The GPI is an aggregate index of over 20 economic, social and environmental indicators, and accounts for both the welfare benefits of economic growth, and the social and environmental costs which accompany that economic growth. The result is better information about the level of welfare or well-being of a country's population. This book measures the GPI of Hong Kong and Singapore from 1968 to 2010. It finds that for both countries, economic output (as measured by the GDP) has grown more than welfare (as measured by the GPI), but important differences are also found. In Hong Kong, the GPI has grown for the whole period under consideration, while in Singapore the GPI has stalled from 1993. This is in line with most countries and is explained by the ""threshold hypothesis"" which states that beyond a certain level of economic development the benefits of further economic growth are outweighed by even higher environmental and social costs. The book argues that the growth of Hong Kong's GPI is due to its favourable relationship with China and in particular its ability to export low-wage jobs and polluting industries, rather than successful domestic policies. A stalling or shrinking GPI calls for alternative policies than the growth economy promoted by neoclassical economists, and the book explores an alternative model, that of the Steady State Economy (SSE). © 2015 Claudio O.

ref_456,Aggregated indicator to assess land use impacts in life cycle assessment (LCA) based on the economic value of ecosystem services,"Soils are one of earth's essential natural resources, supporting nearly all terrestrial life. By and large, current life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methodologies are limited in their assessment of potential land use impacts in terms of terrestrial biodiversity loss. The land use life cycle impact assessment (LULCIA) project spearheaded by the United Nations Environment Programme/Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (UNEP/SETAC) Life Cycle Initiative recently broadened the scope of land use evaluation in life cycle assessment (LCA) by encompassing six additional indicators that represent ecosystem provision and regulation services, as defined in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). Although LCIA methodology is more comprehensive with regards to relevant impact pathways linked to land use, the development could potentially decrease the capacity of LCA as a decision support system by increasing the number of indicators from one to seven for the assessment of the land use impact category alone. To overcome this limitation, the project proposes a new LCIA method to estimate the decrease in value of the ecosystem services provided to society due to land use. The six midpoint land use indicators proposed by the LULCIA project are further modeled into a new area of protection, resources and ecosystem services, based on a functional approach. To do so, indicators expressed in biophysical units are converted into monetary units based on the economic valuation of the reduction of a given ecosystem service. The loss of provision services biotic production and fresh water recharge are estimated through productivity loss and water supply cost, respectively. The regulation services erosion resistance and mechanical and physicochemical water filtration are estimated through the cost of erosion mitigation measures and water purification process costs, respectively. The climate regulation potential is estimated through the social carbon cost: a decrease in carbon sequestration by soils is considered equivalent to an amount of carbon emitted in the atmosphere. We also propose to consider the local socioeconomic context by evaluating the economic adaptation capacity of countries: impacts on the resources and ecosystem services area of protection are only accounted for when the country has the capacity to adapt (while indirect impacts would be calculated by assessing the burdens of the adaptation scenario by performing a full LCA of these adaptation measures). The application of the method is illustrated through a case study evaluating the cradle-to-gate land use impacts of three bio-based polymers (biopolyethylene, polylactic acid and thermoplastic starch) produced in Brazil, Italy, Thailand and the United States. Impact scores are not only influenced by the biophysical specificity of the studied systems (e.g. crop yield affecting the inventory flow, type of biome affecting impact characterisation) but also by the local socioeconomic capacity to compensate for an ecosystem service loss and available compensation measures and technologies. In this case study, thermoplastic starch appears to have fewer impacts on land use and ecosystem services than biopolyethylene or polylactic acid. Overall, the research demonstrates the feasibility of further modeling the biophysical indicators of land use into an economic metric. This additional and complementary modeling step is meant to facilitate the interpretation of LCA results, enabling discussions on the relevance of the biophysical indicators affecting the loss of ecosystem services from land use. It may also be used as an explicit weighting scheme to aggregate the midpoint results into a single value expressing the social cost to compensate for the loss of the ecosystem services. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ref_459,The economics of marine litter,"This chapter aims to provide an overview of research into quantifying the economic impacts of marine litter. From an environmental economics perspective it introduces the difficulties in measuring the economic costs of marine litter; reviews those sectors where these costs are notable; and considers policy instruments, which can reduce these costs. Marine litter is underpinned by dynamic and complex processes, the drivers and impacts of which are multi-scalar, transboundary, and play out in both marine and terrestrial environments. These impacts include economic costs to expenditure, welfare and lost revenue. In most cases, these are not borne by the producers or the polluters. In industries such as fisheries and tourism the costs of marine litter are beginning to be quantified and are considerable. In other areas such as impacts on human health, or more intangible costs related to reduced ecosystem services, more research is evidently needed. As the costs of marine litter are most often used to cover removing debris or recovering from the damage which they have caused, this expenditure represents treatment rather than cure, and although probably cheaper than inaction do not present a strategy for cost reduction. Economic instruments, such as taxes and charges addressing the drivers of waste, for instance those being developed for plastic bags, could be used to reduce the production of marine litter and minimise its impacts. In any case, there remain big gaps in our understanding of the harm caused by marine litter, which presents difficulties when attempting to both quantify its economic costs, and develop effective and efficient instruments to reduce them. © 2015, Springer International Publishing.

ref_463,Economics for environmental professionals,"Environmental professionals are often called upon to find solutions to environmental degradation problems or to lead the way in planning to prevent them. Because they come mainly from the environmental and science disciplines, most environmental professionals have limited training in the fundamentals of economics. This book is designed to provide those professionals not only with the basic principles of economics for foundational purposes but also the economic pros and cons to consider when making critical decisions on environmental issues. Economics for Environmental Professionals provides a fully explanatory, quantitative, and practical introduction to a wide range of topics that make up the science of environmental economics. Moreover, it showcases the power of economic principles to explain and predict issues and current events impacting the environment. It discusses the economics relevant to the environmental mediums of air, water, and land and provides pertinent information on air toxics, hazardous wastes, and other related topics. It provides environmental professionals with the education not only to understand the nuts and bolts of economic analysis but also to conduct economic analyses. Throughout the book, the author joins economics and environmental practice with common-sense approaches and practical real-world examples. Designed to stimulate thought, the book explores strategies for maintaining a safe environment without excessive regulation and cost.

ref_517,Life cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions,"Life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions have been developed for analyzing products ""from cradle to grave"": From resource extraction to waste disposal. Life cycle assessment methodology has also been applied to economies, trade between countries, aspects of production and to waste management, including CO2 capture and sequestration. Life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions are often part of wider environmental assessments, which also cover other environmental impacts. Such wider ranging assessments allow for considering ""trade-offs"" between (reduction of) greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts and co-benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Databases exist which contain estimates of current greenhouse gas emissions linked to fossil fuel use and to many current agricultural and industrial activities. However these data bases do allow for substantial uncertainties in emission estimates. Assessments of greenhouse gas emissions linked to new processes and products are subject to even greater data-linked uncertainty. Variability in outcomes of life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions may furthermore originate in different choices regarding functional units, system boundaries, time horizons, and the allocation of greenhouse gas emissions to outputs in multi-output processes. Life cycle assessments may be useful in the identification of life cycle stages that are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and of major reduction options, in the verification of alleged climate benefits and to establish major differences between competing products. They may also be helpful in the analysis and development of options, policies, and innovations aimed at mitigation of climate change. The main findings from available life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions are summarized, offering guidance in mitigating climate change. Future directions in developing life cycle assessment and its application are indicated.

ref_530,Cents and sustainability: Securing our common future by decoupling economic growth from environmental pressures,"Cents and Sustainability is a clear-sighted response to the 1987 call by Dr Gro Brundtland in Our Common Future to achieve a new era of economic growth that is 'forceful and at the same time socially and environmentally sustainable'. The Brundtland Report argued that not only was it achievable, but that it was an urgent imperative in order to achieve a transition to sustainable development while significantly reducing poverty and driving 'clean and green' investment. With some still arguing for significantly slowing economic growth in order to reduce pressures on the environment, this new book, Cents and Sustainability, shows that it is possible to reconcile the need for economic growth and environmental sustainability through a strategy to decouple economic growth from environmental pressures, combined with a renewed commitment to achieve significant environmental restoration and poverty reduction. Beginning with a brief overview of some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, the book then explains 'decoupling theory', overviews a number of factors that can undermine and even block efforts to decouple in both developed and developing countries, and then discusses a number of key considerations to assist the development of national 'decoupling strategies'. The book then focuses on presenting evidence to support greater action, not just on climate change, but also on decoupling economic growth from the loss of biodiversity and the deterioration of natural systems, freshwater extraction, waste production, and air pollution. In the lead up to the 2012 United Nations Earth Summit and beyond, Cents and Sustainability will be a crucial guide to inform and assist nations to develop strategies to significantly reduce environmental pressures, strengthen their economy, create jobs and reduce poverty.

This IPCC Working Group III volume is a state-of-the-art assessment of the scientific, technical, environmental, economic, and social aspects of the mitigation of climate change. Written by the world's leading experts, the IPCC volumes will again prove to be invaluable for researchers, students, and policymakers, and will form the standard reference works for policy decisions for government and industry worldwide. © Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007.",10.1017/CBO9780511546013,Climate Change IPCC
ref_544,The ecological perspective in chemical engineering,"Complexity issues in the ecological aspects of chemical engineering are of two kinds: the mutual interactions of many multi-scale systems and the lack of consilience in the objectives of different disciplines that consider the economic, philosophical, cultural, and scientific and engineering aspects, respectively. This paper discusses the second kind of complexity and the ecological issues in the different disciplines. Economic value, as expressed by market price, depends on whether limits on resources and the Earth's services due to the scale of human technological activities are taken into account. Human activities relative to the Earth's ecology require sustainability consideration. Two important stands on sustainability are discussed. Mainstream sustainability is a stand for continued economic growth to foster advances in technology to overcome the limits of the Earth. It requires technological activities to follow green chemistry and green engineering principles to develop innovations that are ecologically considerate. Environmental sustainability is a stand to stay within forecasted limits in the resources and renewability capacity of the Earth. The technology for this further includes using the principles of industrial ecology to locate ways to use wastes and recycle products as source materials for other processes to make and close material cycles. Chemical engineering innovations for increased atomic utilization of reactants, efficiency in energy use, dematerialization, non-toxicity, recyclability, and creative systemic cycling of materials for waste management are good for the ecology. Case studies are given showing the utility of following the principles developed for good ecological practice. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
