## Research Question at Everest Bio

- How to develop a generic methodology to assess the **ecosystem services** (ES) rendered by industrial activities operating in short circuit in order to improve decision-making by industrial and public actors? 

### Goals:

- .large.bg-green[To propose and validate indicators to be used for the evaluation of ES of a production activity, and for a short circuit operation.] 

.tiny[

- Propose a protocol for collecting and structuring the data and information necessary to evaluate a particular case, instrumented in a digital tool for data processing and impact assessment.

- Develop an evaluation model of the operational conditions allowing the construction of evaluation scenarios of an activity or industrial sector in a given context.

- To apply the developed model to the case of short circuit recycling of plastics. Validation and feedback to take into account the specific conditions of the local context.

## Natural capital 

.pull-left[

Stock of renewable and non-renewable natural resources (materials/manufactured/information) available to society.

Each form of capital stock generates, either autonomously or in conjunction with services from other capital stocks, a flow of services that may be used to transform materials, or the spatial configuration of materials, to enhance the welfare of humans. 

**The human use of this flow of services may or may not leave the original capital stock intact**

## Typologies of ES:

1. **Regulation functions:** Functions relates to the capacity of natural and semi-natural ecosystems to regulate essential ecological processes and life support systems through bio-geochemical cycles and other biospheric processes. In addition to maintaining ecosystem (and biosphere) health, these regulation functions provide many services that have direct and indirect benefits to humans (such as clean air, water and soil, and biological control services).

2. **Habitat functions:** natural ecosystems provide refuge and reproduction habitat to wild plants and animals and thereby contribute to the (in situ) conservation of biological and genetic diversity and evolutionary processes.

3. **Production functions:** Photosynthesis and nutrient uptake by autotrophs converts energy, carbon dioxide, water and nutrients into a wide variety of carbohydrate structures which are then used by secondary producers to create an even larger variety of living biomass. This broad diversity in carbohydrate structures provides many ecosystem goods for human consumption, ranging from food and raw materials to energy resources and genetic material.

4. **Information functions:** Because most of human evolution took place within the context of undomesticated habitat, natural ecosystems provide an essential ‘reference function’ and contribute to the maintenance of human health by providing opportunities for reflection, spiritual enrichment, cognitive develop- ment, recreation and aesthetic experience.

## Barriers and complexities  

- Adoption of ES in decision-making processes, for example data availability and accuracy, and lack of resources (time, competences, and money) to produce the assessments .fn[@Longato2021]

- "the multiple and overlapping scales of ES" in a plan at the urban scale, considering also that ES knowledge is not always easily translatable into specific spatial units

- The **Waste-Resource Paradox**: Practical dilemmas and societal implications in the transition to a circular economy .fn[@Greer2021]
.small[

- Material: Closing a material loop, which incentivizes overproduction
- Energy: Reducing plastic waste, which requires a new high energy demand to be processed
- Economic: Creating new use for an old waste, which may result in a potential commodification ofwaste and a new market barrier for circular SMEs
- Social: Secondary material recovery, at a cost to human health

# Prototyping the tool

---

## Definitions

According to CICES V5.1:  is built on the principle that a classification of services needs to describe the contribution that ecosystems make to human well-being, defined in terms of ‘what ecosystems do’.
Thus, in the classification the definition of a service needs to highlight the ecological outcomes that particular ecosystem characteristics or processes generate, that can ultimately benefit people. The aim has therefore been to build a classification that identifies the purposes or uses that people have for the different kinds of ecosystem service and associate them with the particular ecosystem attributes or behaviours that support them

Strong: Coming from Ecological rationality 

>The capital is not sustiable, nor reemplazable, interchangable by the financial capital of the physical capital.

Weak: Coming from Economical rationality
