## The problem: Plastic waste

.pull-left[ 
- US recycled less than 9% of its plastic waste.
- EU, recycled about 30%. However, this number is what is collected, not from what is in circulation*. 
- China’s ban on plastic trash
- Plastic trash could top 13 billion tons by 2050
- Economics of plastic recycling historically have been challenging
- Little financial incentive to encourage consumers to recycle their own plastic waste

## We barely recycle plastic!!..

# Challengue

The development of sustainable industrial supply chains

.left-column[
.small[

- Only technico-economic criteria alone do not (no longer) enables a informed decision making 

- Need to assess value chains in a different way, including actual impacts on ecosystems

- A more holistic vision is needed to assess the feasibility of these new sectors.

# Towards a local distributed recycling approach


.pull-left[
- Local closed loop
- AM adds value
- Small quantities 
- Reduction of landfilling
- Minimize the use of virgin materials

# Main Goals

- To develop a generic methodology to assess the ecosystem services rendered by industrial activities operating in short circuit in order to improve decision-making by industrial and public actors. 

- Validation on the case of a short-circuit plastic recycling chain.

---

# Methods

- In line with the thesis work previously carried out by the two teams, development of a coupled Systems Dynamics and LCA approach. 

- Application on a case study, the GreenFablab, by evaluating its environmental impact when setting up a short plastic recycling circuit.

# Delivrables

1. An article in an indexed international journal
2. Participation in an international conference 
3. An operational model with a model of a software tool for assessing local impacts
4. Final report on the evaluation of Green Fablab and possible generalisations for short industrial circuits.
