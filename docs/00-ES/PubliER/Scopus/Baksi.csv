This issue is compounded by the steady, global loss of wetlands and their water quality services. Wetlaculture, an integrated system of wetlands and agriculture, has been proposed as a solution to HABs in which farmland located on former wetlands is flipped to serve as a nutrient-sequestering treatment wetland for a period of years, then flipped back to farmland which consumes the stored nutrients for crop production without the need for fertilizers. A wetlaculture mesocosm experiment was initiated at Buckeye Lake, Ohio in 2016, where all of the site's mesocosms had been functioning as treatment wetlands fed with water from an adjacent, nutrient-impaired stream prior to the 2020 season. This study serves as both a continuation of the treatment wetland experiment, and a first attempt at the cultivation of an agricultural crop in wetlaculture mesocosms. Eight of the twenty-eight mesocosms were drained and planted with corn (Zea mays), while the remaining twenty continued to function as treatment wetlands. Inflow and outflow concentrations of five nutrient species were monitored in the wetland mesocosms, while suitability for corn was evaluated via preplant soil tests and ultimate grain yield, which was compared to that of a nearby commercial farm. End-of-season soil analyses from both the corn and wetland mesocosms were taken to determine the impact of these disparate management regimes on total soil N, P, K, and C. Results indicate that the treatment wetlands continued to improve water quality and that the mesocosms planted with corn produced a grain crop without fertilization. Mesocosm yields (58 ± 9.5 bu./ac) fell significantly below those of the reference farm (160 ± 15.3 bu./ac)(p = 0.004). Some of that difference may be due to the frequent herbivory that occurred during this study, in addition to the limited soil volume in the 0.285 m3 mesocosm tubs versus the open agricultural field. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Corn; Harmful algal blooms; Horticulture; Treatment wetlands; Water quality; Wetlaculture; Wetland mesocosms","Algae control; Crops; Cultivation; Farms; Grain (agricultural product); Lakes; Nutrients; Soil testing; Soils; Water treatment; Wetlands; Corn; Corn production; Harmful algal blooms; Mesocosms; Nonpoint sources; Nutrient pollution; Quality services; Treatment wetlands; Wetlaculture; Wetland mesocosms; Water quality; Junonia coenia; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111890235

Toward meeting this requirement, the idea of including ecosystems as unit operations in process design has been introduced in previous work. To make this idea more practical, this work develops a constructed wetland (CW) simulation module for use in the process simulation tool CHEMCAD. By simulating various combinations of an anaerobic bioreactor (ABR) technology and a CW ecosystem for water treatment, this work shows that CW is most cost-effective if adequate land area is available. Otherwise, a series arrangement with the ABR before the CW makes the most sense. This result introduces a potential design heuristic that technology is better suited than a nature-based solution for a higher concentration of waste. Integrated designs show that cost-effective designs reduce the separation load on distillation by relying more on the lower-cost CW. Recycling water makes economic sense only if the cost of water increases. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Constructed wetlands; Ecosystem services; Process design; Simulation; Sustainable engineering; Water treatment","Biological water treatment; Cost effectiveness; Design; Distillation; Ecosystems; Process design; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Water recycling; Anaerobic bioreactors; Chemical process; Chemical process design; Design benefits; Design simulations; Ecosystem services; In-process; Simulation; Simulation modules; Sustainable engineering; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111034115

We tested the role of leaf density and canopy structure in modulating the rate of dry deposition. We simulated the interactions between a virtual forest patch and deposition rate of an arbitrary scalar using the Parallelized Large Eddy Simulation Model (PALM). Two canopy structures were considered: a homogenous canopy and canopy stripes. For each canopy stripe scenario, we considered thin, intermediate, and wide stripes, while the space between stripes equals the stripes’ width. Four leaf area densities were considered for each case (LAI = 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2). The results showed that denser canopies and canopy stripes experienced more total deposition, noting that stripes had a larger per leaf area deposition than homogeneous canopies. Our results can be explained by canopy-induced turbulence structures that couple the air within and above the canopy and lead to more effective leaf area where this coupling is stronger. We aggregate our results to the whole-patch scale and suggest a canopy-structure and leaf-area dependent correction to the canopy resistance parameter so to be used in coarse models that resolve dry deposition. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Canopy patches; Leaf density; Scalar flux; Surface resistance","air quality; canopy architecture; dry deposition; heterogeneity; large eddy simulation; leaf; leaf area; patch size; spatial analysis; urban atmosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105010137

In this work, we explore the FEW nexus of conventional and techno-ecologically synergistic (TES) systems by evaluating combinations of various technological, agricultural, and ecological strategies from the viewpoints of electricity generation, food production, life cycle water use, carbon footprint, nutrient runoff, corporate profitability, and societal well-being. We evaluate activities related to power generation (coal and gas extraction and use, transportation options, cooling technologies, solar panels, wind turbines), food production (farming with and without tillage), waste utilization (carbon dioxide capture and conversion to hydrocarbons, green hydrogen), and ecological restoration (forests and wetlands). Application of this framework to the Muskingum River watershed in Ohio, U.S.A. indicates that seeking synergies between human and natural systems can provide innovative solutions that improve the FEW nexus while making positive contributions to society with greater respect for nature's limits. We show that the conventional engineering approach of relying only on technological approaches for meeting sustainability objectives can have limited environmental and societal benefits while reducing profitability. In contrast, techno-ecologically synergistic design between agricultural systems and wetlands can reduce nutrient runoff with little compromise in other goals. Additional synergies between farming and photovoltaic systems along with the use of wetlands can further improve the FEW nexus while reducing CO2 and nutrient emissions, with a relatively small compromise in corporate profitability. These results should motivate further work on innovative TES designs that can provide ""win-win""solutions for meeting global energy needs in an environmentally and socially beneficial manner. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Agricultural robots; Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Coal transportation; Conservation; Ecology; Electric power generation; Life cycle; Nutrients; Photovoltaic cells; Profitability; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermal processing (foods); Wetlands; Agricultural system; Carbon dioxide capture; Ecological restoration; Electricity generation; Innovative solutions; Nutrient emissions; Photovoltaic systems; Sustainability objectives; Coal industry; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental restoration; food; food production; power generation; sustainability; sustainable development; technical efficiency; waste technology; Muskingum River; Ohio; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110841923

Vehicle components can be lightweighted by replacing conventional materials with alternatives such as aluminum or composites. However, lightweight materials come with their own set of environmental and economic challenges. Often, manufacturing of lightweight materials requires more energy than for conventional materials such as steel. Understanding the net energy and environmental benefits of lightweighting requires life cycle assessment with a large enough system boundary to prevent shifting of impacts and to ensure a fair comparison between different material options. Life cycle assessments of carbon fiber composite parts are hampered by substantial uncertainties in the energy needed for their production and recycling and the vehicle fuel consumption benefits. The present study addresses these deficiencies using a detailed vehicle fuel consumption model and industrially relevant carbon fiber production data and component design. The front subframe case study considered illustrates the challenges associated with achieving life cycle energy and greenhouse gas savings using carbon fiber. The base case with no powertrain resizing, secondary weight savings, or recycled carbon fiber and with 160,000 miles vehicle lifetime has no energy or emission benefits. When powertrain resizing, secondary weight savings, carbon fiber recycling, and increased vehicle lifetime travel were considered, energy and greenhouse gas benefits were found. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Subframe; Vehicle lightweighting","Aluminum coated steel; Automobile manufacture; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Graphite fibers; Greenhouse gases; Powertrains; Recycling; Carbon fiber composite; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Conventional materials; Environmental benefits; Fuel-efficient vehicles; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Lightweight materials; Vehicle lightweighting; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102148657

Many opportunities to recycle, down-cycle or up-cycle products have also been identified for enabling greater circularity. However, to obtain a Sustainable Circular Economy (SCE) there is a need to holistically assess and design entire value chains of the product while considering various alternatives that may be available at each stage of its circular network. Systematic methods are also needed to determine the environmental, economic, and social implications of various value chain pathways and quantify their trade-offs with circularity from the perspective of multiple stakeholders. We propose a systematic and rigorous computational framework to analyze existing circular systems and develop new designs. This framework combines the computational approach of life cycle assessment with optimization-based approaches for process synthesis and network representation. Life-cycle networks are modified to contain multiple alternatives along the value chain and permit circular flows between modules. Four basic types of nodes are identified such that any SCE network may be represented as their combination. The additional degrees of freedom generated in such a superstructure network are determined by using principles of allocation and displacement, material-energy balances and physico-chemical governing equations of modules, thereby permitting integration of fundamental models with data-based LCA methods. Typical cases that may arise in potential circular value chains are formulated and solved to highlight the wide applicability of the framework. Both analysis and synthesis methods are proposed to evaluate candidate pathways within the superstructure network. Application of this framework to illustrative examples highlights its use for systematic design of circular value chains to meet SCE goals by quantifying the trade-offs between objectives. Such a framework is needed to develop general software to study the scope of innovation at different stages of the value chain, and contribute toward optimal closing of the cycles of different materials. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Life-cycle analysis; Multi-objective optimization; Process synthesis; Sustainable design","Commerce; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Multiobjective optimization; Product design; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Circular networks; Computational framework; Environmental implications; Lifecycle analysis; Multi-objectives optimization; Process synthesis; Systematic method; Trade off; Value chains; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102297500

A prequel study has proposed a 4-step methodology that integrates the ES cascade framework within the cause-effect chain of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) to characterize the physical and monetary impacts on ES provisioning due to human interventions. We here follow the suggested steps in the abovementioned study, to demonstrate the first application of the integrated ES-LCIA methodology and the added value for LCA studies, using a case study of rice farming in the United States, China, and India. Four ES are considered, namely carbon sequestration, water provisioning, air quality regulation, and water quality regulation. The analysis found a net negative impact for rice farming systems in all three rice producing countries, meaning the detrimental impacts of rice farming on ES being greater than the induced benefits on ES. Compared to the price of rice sold in the market, the negative impacts represent around 2%, 6%, and 4% of the cost of 1 kg of rice from China, India, and the United States, respectively. From this case study, research gaps were identified in order to develop a fully operationalized ES-LCIA integration. With such a framework and guidance in place, practitioners can more comprehensively assess the impacts of life cycle activities on relevant ES provisioning, in both physical and monetary terms. This may in turn affect stakeholders' availability to receive such benefits from ecosystems in the long run. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cascade model; Cause-effect chain; Ecosystem services; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA); Rice farming","Air quality; Decision support systems; Ecosystems; Sustainable development; Water quality; Air quality regulations; Carbon sequestration; Decision support tools; Environmental sustainability; Life cycle activities; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Valuation of ecosystem services; Life cycle; crop yield; ecosystem service; farming system; life cycle analysis; rice; stakeholder; sustainability; water quality; yield response; air quality control; Article; carbon sequestration; China; comparative study; environmental management; farming system; human; India; life cycle assessment; priority journal; rice; social marketing; United States; water quality; agriculture; ecosystem; environmental protection; Oryza; China; India; United States; Agriculture; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; India; Oryza",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089227160

Though the dependence of direct users is easily acknowledged, indirect vulnerability imposed on downstream sectors of the economic system is not as easily understood. In the context of growing water scarcity across India, this study maps the dependence of prominent sectors of the Indian economy to the water-withdrawal model of India (Bogra, Bakshi, & Mathur, 2016). From the suppliers' perspective, the results indicate that embodied water of the largest direct water-withdrawing food sectors namely, Paddy, Wheat, and Sugarcane (PWS) is indirectly consumed mostly by the consumptive food sectors. However, from the users' perspective, even non-food sectors exhibit a significant dependence on the embodied water of PWS. Further, blue-water-based structural path analysis (SPA) of Paddy and Wheat indicate significant contributions to Land transport, Construction, and Beverages, among others, whereas Land transport is important in terms of green water too. The out-degree measure indicates a higher dependence of the economy on Electricity (blue water) and Forestry (green water) sectors. Specifically, infrastructural sectors exhibit a significant dependence on Electricity; whereas Forestry products contribute to non-food sectors. State-wise water-scarcity indices (WSIs) indicate higher dependence of Electricity on scarce surface-water flows of north-western and central states, whereas forested areas in the north and north-eastern parts of India exhibit lowest ground WSIs. By integrating regional flows with sectoral dependencies, it is observed that the risk to a reduction of the economy's throughput is higher from water withdrawn by Electricity compared to food sectors, PWS. © 2020 by Yale University","environmental input–output analysis; industrial ecology; metrics; structural path analysis; supply-chain management; sustainability assessment","Forestry; Regression analysis; Surface waters; Timber; Economic activities; Economic sectors; Economic system; Forestry products; Land transport; Resource scarcity; Surface water flows; Water withdrawal; Economics; economic system; food industry; numerical model; path analysis; risk assessment; sugar cane; vulnerability; wheat; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086160797

Thus, RubisCO is nature's CO2-sequestering enzyme that is present in chloroplasts. As an effort to mitigate climate change, biomimetic carbon fixation technologies have been developed through RubisCO immobilization into nanostructures to form nanostructure-RubisCO complexes. The technologies mimic the plant cellular environment's ability to convert CO2 into higher-value products. In this work, a carbon footprint of 3-PGA produced through carbon fixation by the complexes is investigated using the LCA approach. Serine, an amino acid for pharmaceutical applications, is identified as a potential product from 3-PGA. Hotspot processes in terms of the carbon footprint are identified to suggest potential improvements for emerging technologies. Conducting LCA for emerging technologies has many challenges. A sensitivity analysis is performed for uncertain data, and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) preparation process for the 3-PGA production is identified as a hotspot inventory. We identify that the carbon footprint to produce 3-PGA can be significantly lowered by integrating carbon fixation technologies with an electrochemical ATP regeneration technology. © 2020 ACS.

Woodruff Avenue, Columbus, OH  43210, United States","Purpose: Despite the wide use of LCA for environmental profiling, the approach for determining the system boundary within LCA models continues to be subjective and lacking in mathematical rigor. As a result, life cycle models are often developed in an ad hoc manner, and are difficult to compare. Significant environmental impacts may be inadvertently left out. Overcoming this shortcoming can help elicit greater confidence in life cycle models and their use for decision making. Methods: This paper describes a framework for hybrid life cycle model generation by selecting activities based on their importance, parametric uncertainty, and contribution to network complexity. The importance of activities is determined by structural path analysis—which then guides the construction of life cycle models based on uncertainty and complexity indicators. Information about uncertainty is from the available life cycle inventory; complexity is quantified by cost or granularity. The life cycle model is developed in a hierarchical manner by adding the most important activities until error requirements are satisfied or network complexity exceeds user-specified constraints. Results and Discussion: The framework is applied to an illustrative example for building a hybrid LCA model. Since this is a constructed example, the results can be compared with the actual impact, to validate the approach. This application demonstrates how the algorithm sequentially develops a life cycle model of acceptable uncertainty and network complexity. Challenges in applying this framework to practical problems are discussed. Conclusion: The presented algorithm designs system boundaries between scales of hybrid LCA models, includes or omits activities from the system based on path analysis of environmental impact contribution at upstream network nodes, and provides model quality indicators that permit comparison between different LCA models. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Life cycle analysis; Network analysis; System boundary; Uncertainty","algorithm; article; decision making; environmental impact; life cycle assessment; path analysis; quantitative analysis; uncertainty; validation process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093073187

The product technical requirements are first identified as design constraints. Then, a base-case product is generated as a reference on top of which a more sustainable product is designed. To do so, the life cycle of base-case product (in particular, whether and how it should be recycled) is decided by using life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) or rule-based methods depending on the availability of life cycle inventory data. In addition, the hotspots (i.e., life cycle stages with major impact) are identified. Afterwards, to reduce the impact on hotspots, product design targets and design alternatives are generated using knowledge-base and heuristics. Lastly, LCSA or rule-based methods is applied to decide the most sustainable product from the generated product design alternatives.

Servicesheds are one of these emerging concepts and can be qualitatively described as the areas which provide ecosystem services to specific beneficiaries. Previous research lacks the use of mathematical, spatially-explicit models to connect beneficiaries with the ecosystem services that are provided to them by neighboring ecosystems. Working with an atmospheric dispersion model, CALPUFF, this research focuses on air quality regulating ecosystem services and specifically, dry deposition of gaseous pollutants. Multiple quantitative, reproducible, and spatially-explicit definitions of the serviceshed concept are proposed. The various definitions are dependent on the model's results for concentration and dry deposition values. To discuss the application of these quantitative serviceshed definitions, a case study is conducted for a biodiesel manufacturing site in Cincinnati, OH. The results of the proposed serviceshed definitions yield different and complimentary information for the air quality regulation services. The results of these spatially-explicit definitions yield maps with serviceshed boundaries, which can inform ecosystem restoration and management decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality regulation; Atmospheric transport; Ecosystem service mapping; Ecosystem service valuation; Serviceshed; Spatial modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077130531

Methods for making decisions toward sustainability certainly account for technological aspects such as efficiency, but have been lacking in accounting for the broader economic implications such as the effect of markets and human behavior. These shortcomings can result in perverse outcomes: improvement in efficiency may increase environmental impact by encouraging greater consumption. Recent advances in sustainability assessment include methods that range from ignoring the economy to considering price changes and elasticity effects.

Based on data about annual emissions in U.S. counties and current land cover, we show that existing forest, grassland, and shrubland vegetation take up a significant portion of current U.S. emissions. Restoring land cover, where possible, to county-level average canopy cover can further remove pollution of SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 by an average of 27% through interception of particulate matter and absorption of gaseous pollutants. We find such nature-based solutions to be cheaper than technology for several National Emission Inventory sectors. Our results with and without monetary valuation of ecological cobenefits identify sectors and counties that are most economically attractive for nature-based solutions as compared to the use of pollution control technologies. We also estimate the sizes of urban and rural populations that would benefit from this novel ecosystem-based approach. This suggests that even though vegetation cannot fully negate the impact of emissions at all times, policies encouraging ecosystems as control measures in addition to technological solutions may promote large investments in ecological restoration and provide several societal benefits.

Within the flagship project of the Life Cycle Initiative (hosted by UN Environment), aiming at global guidance for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) indicators, a dedicated subtask force was constituted to consolidate the evaluation of ES in LCA. As one of the outcomes of this subtask force, this paper describes the progress towards consensus building in the LCA domain concerning the assessment of anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems and their associated services for human well-being. To this end, the traditional LCIA structure, which represents the cause-effect chain from stressor to impacts and damages, is re-casted and expanded using the lens of the ES ‘cascade model’. This links changes in ecosystem structure and function to changes in human well-being, while LCIA links the effect of changes on ecosystems due to human impacts (e.g. land use change, eutrophication, freshwater depletion) to the increase or decrease in the quality and/or quantity of supplied ES. The proposed cascade modelling framework complements traditional LCIA with information about the externalities associated with the supply and demand of ES, for which the overall cost-benefit result might be either negative (i.e. detrimental impact on the ES provision) or positive (i.e. increase of ES provision). In so doing, the framework introduces into traditional LCIA the notion of “benefit” (in the form of ES supply flows and ecosystems' capacity to generate services) which balances the quantified environmental intervention flows and related impacts (in the form of ES demands) that are typically considered in LCA. Recommendations are eventually provided to further address current gaps in the analysis of ES within the LCA methodology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","benefit; cascade model; cause-effect chain; ecosystem services; life cycle assessment (LCA); valuation","Cost benefit analysis; Decision support systems; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Land use; Resource valuation; Stream flow; Supply chains; benefit; CASCADE model; Cause-effect; Ecosystem services; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle; fresh water; anthropogenic effect; ecosystem service; ecosystem structure; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; supply chain management; Article; consensus development; decision support system; drought; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; eutrophication; human impact (environment); information processing; land use; life cycle assessment; methodology; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068832869

These consequences could occur through the entire supply chain at multiple spatial scales. In this work, the process-to-planet (P2P) multiscale modeling framework is integrated with the rectangular choice-of-technology (RCOT) consequential approach. The resulting RCOT-P2P multiscale technology choice modeling framework takes account of market effects, such as economic resource constraints, as a consequential approach for designing engineering systems and their supply chain networks. The integrated modeling framework can represent different stakeholders’ interests by considering engineering, environmental, and economic dimensions. The case study focuses on installation of a new green urea production system in a watershed where there are limited supplies of resources, such as water and land area. We identify how the adoption of new technologies could change and be limited by market constraints, as the urea demand increases.

This is a side effect from the supply chain of products from agricultural biomass, and renders many bio-based products environmentally unsustainable. Most existing efforts for designing sustainable supply chains aim to reduce the life cycle environmental impact, while ignoring nature's role in absorbing the emissions. Using the framework of techno-ecological synergy (TES), this work explicitly accounts for the role of wetlands in absorbing farm runoff to design environmentally sustainable biofuel supply chains. Application to a twenty-one county region of Northwest Ohio, which is largely responsible for HABs in Lake Erie, indicates opportunities for designing techno-ecological supply networks that are economically and ecologically superior to conventional techno-centric networks. Using the TES framework also provides counterintuitive solutions that encourage intensive agriculture with higher phosphorus runoff if there is enough land available for conversion into wetland ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Algal blooms; Biofuel; Ecosystem services; Eutrophication; Process design; Sustainable supply chains","Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Algae control; Biofuels; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Lakes; Process design; Sustainable development; Wetlands; Agricultural biomass; Algal blooms; Biofuel supply chains; Ecosystem services; Environmental challenges; Harmful algal blooms; Life-cycle environmental impact; Sustainable supply chains; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064457197

To contribute to sustainability, chemical engineering needs to address this paradox by developing chemical products and processes that meet the needs of present and future generations. Unintended harm of chemical engineering has usually appeared outside the discipline's traditional system boundary due to shifting of impacts across space, time, flows, or disciplines, and exceeding nature's capacity to supply goods and services. Being a subdiscipline of chemical engineering, process systems engineering (PSE) is best suited for ensuring that chemical engineering makes net positive contributions to sustainable development. This article reviews the role of PSE in the quest toward a sustainable chemical engineering. It focuses on advances in metrics, process design, product design, and process dynamics and control toward sustainability. Efforts toward contributing to this quest have already expanded the boundary of PSE to consider economic, environmental, and societal aspects of processes, products, and their life cycles. Future efforts need to account for the role of ecosystems in supporting industrial activities, and the effects of human behavior and markets on the environmental impacts of chemical products. Close interaction is needed between the reductionism of chemical engineering science and the holism of process systems engineering, along with a shift in the engineering paradigm from wanting to dominate nature to learning from it and respecting its limits.

This reduces the chance of shifting impacts outside the system boundary. However, sustainability also requires that supporting ecosystems are not adversely affected and remain capable of providing goods and services for supporting human activities. Conventional LCA does not account for this role of nature, and its metrics are best for comparing alternatives. These relative metrics do not provide information about absolute environmental sustainability, which requires comparison between the demand and supply of ecosystem services (ES). Techno-ecological synergy (TES) is a framework to account for ES, and has been demonstrated by application to systems such as buildings and manufacturing activities that have narrow system boundaries. This article develops an approach for techno-ecological synergy in life cycle assessment (TES-LCA) by expanding the steps in conventional LCA to incorporate the demand and supply of ecosystem goods and services at multiple spatial scales. This enables calculation of absolute environmental sustainability metrics, and helps identify opportunities for improving a life cycle not just by reducing impacts, but also by restoring and protecting ecosystems. TES-LCA of a biofuel life cycle demonstrates this approach by considering the ES of carbon sequestration, air quality regulation, and water provisioning. Results show that for the carbon sequestration ecosystem service, farming can be locally sustainable but unsustainable at the global or serviceshed scale. Air quality regulation is unsustainable at all scales, while water provisioning is sustainable at all scales for this study in the eastern part of the United States. © 2018 by Yale University","biofuel; ecosystem services; environmental metrics; industrial ecology; life cycle assessment (LCA); sustainability assessment","Air quality; Biofuels; Carbon; Life cycle; Mergers and acquisitions; Sustainable development; Ecosystem services; Environmental metrics; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Sustainability assessment; Ecosystems; air quality; biofuel; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; environmental impact; human activity; industrial ecology; life cycle analysis; sustainability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043227062

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of various individual sectors in India in terms of their efficiency of resource utilization. This study identifies the major inefficient sectors and subunits that have maximum improvement potential. It analyses how the change in resource flow, policy, and socio-economic changes in each sector have affected the overall scenario. By analyzing the trends, it is observed that the average exergy efficiency for electricity generation has continued to decrease with increased share of coal-fuelled thermal power generation. Out of the sectors studied, the residential sector is found to be the least exergy efficient (13%), followed by the transportation (22.5%) and utility sectors (33.5%). The overall exergy utilization efficiency of the industry sector is in the range 24% to 75%.

Comparing emissions with the average uptake capacity at each site indicates that currently most sites in the Southeastern part of the U.S. Have enough vegetation cover to offset most emissions while industrial facilities, particularly those in the Western part of the country can benefit the most from restoration.

However, system boundary problem and other deficiencies of LCA propagates down to the design problem, resulting in suboptimal solutions. While conventional LCA methods have mostly been attributional in nature, a new branch of LCA, known as consequential LCA has developed which is more practical and realistic for application to decision making. The main objective of this LCA method is to account for direct and indirect consequences due to a certain decision such as introduction of a new environmentally friendly product or technology. In this work, we explore some of the approaches being used for consequential LCA from a sustainable process design perspective and develop a multiscale framework that can combine policy design, supply chain design and design of manufacturing processes.

Despite these efforts, human impact on nature is still significant as engineering tends to ignore nature's capacity to provide goods and services which leads to ecological overshoot. Hence, in order to design truly sustainable systems, one should consider alternatives that can help reduce ecological overshoot and avoid unintended consequences. Nature-based solutions like forest, wetlands, etc. can help alleviate ecological capacity and avoid unintended consequences, as nature has always been “sustainable”. In order to use these ecological solutions, traditional large-scale chemical processing facilities have to embrace and respect the intermittent seasonal availability of ecological goods and services. In this work, we consider a chloralkali production with attached utility generator that is located in Freeport Texas, which is a nitrogen dioxide (NO2) non-attainment zone where NO2 emissions are not permitted. Utility generation unit emits nitrogen dioxide and the goal of the operator is to limit emission of NO2 for which we explore two alternatives: 1) a technological unit known as Selective Catalytic Reactor (SCR) 2) an ecological solution in form of forest ecosystem. We use iTree-Eco and Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to model monthly capacity of forest ecosystem to take up NO2 emissions over a period of 20 years. Combining the technological and ecological models, we solve a stochastic mixed integer design and operation planning problem to find optimal combination of technology and nature. This novel synergistic solution is economically and environmentally superior manufacturing approach compared to traditional systems that ignore nature's ability to provide goods and services. These results demonstrate the need to shift from traditional engineering paradigm of out pacing nature to adopting the dynamics of nature to get maximum sustainable profitability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Design under uncertainty; Ecosystem services; Sustainability; Techno-ecological synergy",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069913942

Such an approach largely ignores the role of ecosystem services (ES) and ecological carrying capacity, despite their essential role in sustaining all human activities. Such ignorance may lead to the over-dependence on scarce resources, perverse impacts on ecosystems, and lost opportunities for improvement. The framework of Techno-Ecological Synergy (TES) accounts for the demand and supply of ES at multiple spatial scales and defines metrics for absolute sustainability at both local and serviceshed scales. Applications of TES have been mainly focusing on localized systems. To prevent the shifting of impacts, a life cycle perspective is also needed. The authors have proposed the Techno-Ecological Synergy in Life Cycle Assessment (TES-LCA) framework by modifying each step in conventional LCA to incorporate the role of ecosystem goods and services. On one hand, TES-LCA advocates conventional solutions of impact reduction through technological improvements. On the other hand, it provides additional insights, including discovering novel ecological solutions to push toward absolute environmental sustainability. Thus, TES-LCA can offer a more comprehensive portfolio on sustainability performance evaluation. The substantial benefits of TES-LCA have been demonstrated by an application to urban farms. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of ecosystem services (ES) in supporting technological activities is still ignored. Techno-Ecological Synergies in Life Cycle Assessment (TES-LCA) is a methodology that captures the interactions between and within technological and ecological systems, along a product's life cycle. It accounts for local and absolute environmental sustainability by comparing the demand and supply of ES at multiple spatial scales. To facilitate its wider adoption, the basic computational framework has been proposed in Part 1, which includes technologies and ecosystems in an integrated manner. To handle the complications induced by explicitly considering ES, which operate within servicesheds at multiple spatial scales, the TES-LCA computational structure is modified to account for spatial variation in technological and ecological systems in Part 2. The regionalized TES-LCA framework is demonstrated through an expanded case study to show its capability to capture different scenarios of regionalization, including variation in process efficiency, ecological carrying capacity (CC), characterization factors (CF), and the scales at which ES operate. The approach is then proved to be general and able to subsume existing approaches, such as regionalized LCA, GIS-LCA and recent extensions based on normalizing CF by ecological CC to calculate absolute sustainability metrics. It is recommended that the developed computational structure should be implemented in LCA software with the functionality for handling geographical information. Also, the regionalized information about ES demand and supply needs to be made available in future versions of life cycle inventory databases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computational structure; Ecosystem service; Environmental sustainability; Life cycle assessment","Ecosystems; Efficiency; Sustainable development; Characterization factors; Computational structure; Ecological carrying capacity; Ecosystem services; Environmental sustainability; Geographical information; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle inventory database; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049356700

Various approaches have been suggested for including ES in LCA but a general computational framework is not yet available. This paper extends the framework of conventional process LCA to assess and encourage techno-ecological synergies in life cycle assessment (TES-LCA). It includes ecosystem modules along with process modules in LCA. Analogous to the technology matrix in conventional LCA, TES-LCA defines a “techno-ecological” matrix. It consists of four components: a technology matrix defined by economic flows, an intervention matrix interpreted as the ES demanded by technological activities, an ecosystem matrix interpreted as the capacity of ecosystems to supply these services, and a management matrix to capture the interaction between technological and ecological systems. This work demonstrates the computational structure through a toy example and discuss the major challenges of TES-LCA in terms of data availability for an exhaustive array of ES. This work suggests that such data need to be made available and included in future versions of life cycle inventory databases. The computational structure of TES-LCA is able to capture the interactions between and within technological and ecological systems. It enables including of the role and capacity of ecosystems in a life cycle. The framework can encourage development of data and models to enable practical use of TES-LCA, which can provide unique insights into absolute environmental sustainability by quantifying overshoots for specific ES, and help identify improvement strategies based on improving technological efficiency and restoring ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computational structure; Ecosystem service; Environmental sustainability; Life cycle assessment","Life cycle; Matrix algebra; Sustainable development; Computational framework; Computational structure; Ecosystem services; Environmental sustainability; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle inventory database; Technological activity; Technological efficiency; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049034719

The system includes land use activities and biomass conversion processes for the production of energy carriers, as well as supporting ecosystems that increase the supply of key ecosystem services. The co-production system was linearized and reduced to a mixed-integer linear program, which was optimized for single objectives under a variety of production and sustainability constraints. Results indicate that for the system considered to achieve high food and energy co-production, land use options should be balanced between food-producing crops and electricity-producing wind turbines and solar panels. Results also show that ecological sustainability can be achieved for this system with relatively small changes in land use patterns.

Recent efforts for sustainable process design aim to reduce environmental impact, but no design method considers the capacity of ecosystems to supply the goods and services that are needed to sustain a process. Overcoming this deficiency of conventional process design is essential to transform the chemical industry into an activity that respects ecological constraints and results in a net positive societal impact. As an important step toward meeting this goal, this work expands the boundary of process design to include ecosystems as unit operations in traditional design. Similar to tasks performed by conventional unit operations, ecological processes perform ecosystem functions resulting in goods and services required by the technological system. The goal behind designing integrated techno-ecological process flowsheets is to balance the ecosystem service demand of technological systems with the ecosystem service supply of ecological systems. Systems are optimized to balance the demand and supply subject to unit operation level constraints of technological and ecological systems, and interactions between detailed process level variables and ecological variables are explored. The Techno-Ecological Synergy (TES) Design method is developed and applied to a biofuel production system, considering ecosystem services like water provisioning and water quality regulation provided by wetland ecosystems. Comparing the integrated TES design with conventional techno-centric design shows that TES design can result in net positive impact manufacturing: a case where the ecosystem service supply is equal to or exceeds the demand, with little or no compromises in process profitability. These results should encourage close integration between technological and ecological systems while designing sustainable processes, and identify many challenges for developing TES of individual processes and across the life cycle. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 64: 2390–2407, 2018. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","ecosystems; environmental engineering; process design; process synthesis; sustainable engineering","Chemical industry; Ecosystems; Environmental engineering; Environmental impact; Manufacture; Process design; Sustainable development; Water quality; Wetlands; Ecological variables; Ecosystem functions; Integrated process designs; Manufacturing process; Process synthesis; Sustainable engineering; Sustainable process; Technological system; Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041281239

However, biofuels must be evaluated on multiple criteria to ensure they truly are an improvement over the fossil fuels they are to replace. This study evaluates the carbon (C) footprint (emissions – sequestration) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions footprint of two fossil fuels, two first generation biofuels, and eight cellulosic fuels, many with process inputs allocated multiple ways to allow for different valuation of inputs and products. For both C and Nr results, fossil and first generation fuels were often the worst options, while cellulosic fuels look notably better, often in both criteria. For most fuels, there is a trade-off between a low C footprint and low Nr emissions footprint, which is investigated throughout the entire nutrient cycles here. Biofuels usually have lower C footprints and higher Nr emissions due to intensive farming processes, while fossil fuels have a high C footprint and lower Nr emissions. However, cellulosic fuels from feedstocks with low farming inputs switchgrass and low intensity high diversity grassland, or from waste feedstocks, such as municipal solid waste and newsprint have low C and Nr footprints, making them better options for transportation fuels. However, just because these fuels have smaller C and Nr footprints than other fuels does not imply they are absolutely sustainable. The capacity of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services should also be considered before sustainability claims are made. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon-nitrogen nexus; Transportation fuels","Ecology; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Municipal solid waste; Nitrogen; Ecosystem services; Low-intensity; Multiple criteria; Nutrient cycle; Process inputs; Reactive nitrogen; Switchgrass; Transportation fuels; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042074622

The present study evaluates how the TES framework based on emergy can shed new light by comparing conventional technological alternatives and ecological alternatives for meeting a particular ecosystem service demand. Both the demand and supply of ecosystem services are quantified in consistent units of emergy to obtain aggregated TES metrics. Specifically it was found that additional equipment to treat air pollutants have a higher emergy investment as compared to the forest ecosystem, while the technological unit to treat wastewater requires less emergy as compared to the horizontal subsurface flow wetland, its ecological counterpart. This new approach is tested by application to a biodiesel production plant and by calculating emergy metrics.

We address this challenge based on a meta-principle for sustainability: human activities should not exceed critical ecosystem capacity, and by translating this principle into six specific requirements that sustainability assessment methods should satisfy. These necessary but not sufficient requirements are to ensure that decisions made by these methods do not demand more from ecosystems than can be supplied, and actions meant to reduce environmental impact do not shift the problem outside the system boundary. By applying these requirements to existing methods, we identify their benefits and shortcomings, and use this insight to suggest a multidisciplinary path forward.

However, knowledge about what makes the solutions optimal can be more valuable as it can be formulated as heuristics for guiding future designs of similar systems. In this paper, we propose a methodology that couples multiobjective optimization and machine learning to extract design heuristics. The methodology has been demonstrated by a case study on sustainable residential system design. Potential heuristics for sustainable buildings include: 1) keep the house as warm as comfortable in the summer and as cold as comfortable in the winter; 2) place vegetable garden, shading trees, and rain water harvesting system around the house. This further indicates the benefits of the synergistic design between technologies and ecosystems. The approach of combining optimization with learning is general enough to be applied to other systems, ranging from local manufacturing processes to urban systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Heuristic extraction; machine learning; multiobjective optimization; sustainable built environment",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050693467

This has been the system boundary at least since the industrial revolution when the human footprint was quite small, and nature seemed infinite. With this situation having reversed in the modern world, there is an urgent need to change the engineering paradigm from one that takes nature for granted to one that accounts for the role of nature and works with it while respecting its limits. In this article we argue that such a paradigm shift holds the promises of enabling sustainability and innovation by developing engineering that benefits from nature's ability to treat emissions and provide resources in an economically viable and environmentally sustainable manner. We provide an overview of recent progress in including nature in engineering, for tasks such as design of processes and supply chains, and for life cycle assessment. Despite the promise of including nature in engineering, there are also risks if this inclusion is not done properly. Current methods tend to commodify nature due to which holistic characteristics of ecosystems such as biodiversity and resilience could be lost.

The Process to Planet (P2P) framework bridges this gap by combining sustainable process design with environmentally extended input output analysis. This framework extending across multiple scales provides the capability of working with process variables and designing processes at the equipment scale while considering the entire life cycle through the supply chain and economic scale models. This work expands the P2P framework to account for byproducts originating from any unit within the model. The framework is further modified to incorporate an economic objective function, henceforth developing a multiobjective (MO) optimization problem for optimal design of any generic industrial process. The modified P2P framework is demonstrated by application to a corn ethanol manufacturing process case study. The MO problem is solved using the epsilon constraint method to obtain Pareto optimal frontiers that reveal the trade-off between environmental and economic dimensions of the sustainable process design problem. Comparison between commonly practiced conventional SPD and P2P SPD Pareto curves exposes the chance of choosing non optimal solutions if the former method is employed. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","design; multiobjective optimization; multiscale modeling; sustainability","Bridges; Byproducts; Design; Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Life cycle; Machine design; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Optimization; Pareto principle; Peer to peer networks; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Economic objective function; Epsilon-constraint method; Input output analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Manufacturing process; Multi-scale Modeling; Optimization problems; Pareto-optimal frontiers; Process design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042846410

Until now, most studies that have focused on identifying the best treatment pathway are based on optimization of technological alternatives and life cycle analysis studies. Such studies aim toward sustainability but ignore the capacity of local ecological systems to provide ecosystem services, thus leading to design solutions that may be sub-optimal due to shifting of impacts outside the boundary, resulting in degradation. This work uses a techno-ecological synergy design methodology to identify optimal strategies for biosolids treatment and disposal, by balancing the supply and demand for carbon sequestration ecosystem service. Both the technological systems that create the ecosystem service demand and ecological systems that supply those services are included within one design framework. Technological alternatives for biosolids management in Central Ohio considered in this work are land filling, land application, incineration and composting. Approaches for supplying the carbon sequestration capacity include forestation, extension of timber cycles and geological sequestration. An additional case where biomass utilization from extension of timber cycle to produce renewable energy is also explored. Results from this study demonstrate that including carbon sequestration ecosystem service explicitly in the design problem leads to solutions where the ecosystem service demand and supply can be balanced, while also being cost-effective. Thus by including ecological systems in the design boundary, the optimal solution space expands to reveal novel solutions that cannot be found by the conventional techno-centric approach. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Biosolids management; Carbon sequestration ecosystem service; Multiobjective optimization; Techno-ecological synergy","Biosolids; Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Design; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Industrial emissions; Industrial water treatment; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Timber; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Biosolids management; Ecosystem services; Geological sequestration; Municipal wastewaters; Techno-ecological synergy; Technological alternatives; Technological system; Treatment and disposal; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026460681

Delhi's community-wide food demand includes household consumption by socio-economic-strata, visitors- and industrial food-use. This demand depends 90%, 76%, and 86% on trans-boundary supply of FEW, respectively. Supply chain data reveal unique features of trans-boundary FEW production regions (e.g. irrigation-electricity needs and GHG intensities of power-plants), yielding supply chain-informed coupled energy-water-GHG footprints of FEW provisioning to Delhi. Agri-food supply contributes to both GHG (19%) and water-footprints (72%-82%) of Delhi's FEW provisioning, with milk, rice and wheat dominating these footprints. Analysis of FEW interactions within Delhi found >75% in-boundary water-use for food is for urban agriculture and >76% in-boundary energy-use for food is from cooking fuels. Food waste-to-energy and energy-intensity of commercial and industrial food preparation are key data gaps. Visualizing supply chains shows >75% of water embodied in Delhi's FEW supply is extracted from locations over-drafting ground water.

Comparing the national metabolism of developed and developing societies can shed useful light into how efficiently the useful potential of resources is being used to identify potential pitfalls and opportunities for sustainable development. Such analysis may also help avoid and leapfrog over some of the mistakes of developed countries. Such research could assist in finding answers to some critical questions like whether developing societies like India are being more sustainable than developed societies in terms of resource utilization. Comparing historical trends of resource use across multiple societies also sheds light on how the resource mix changes with efforts toward sustainability. The primary objective of this work is to gain greater understanding of India's economic growth over the last four decades (1970–2010) by analyzing its reliance on useful work or exergy derived from various natural resources. Such insight can help determine whether India is following a path of sustainable development. If the country is not on this path, this work can help identify opportunities for improvement. Acquiring such data was itself a formidable challenge, making this the first database of its type. This paper presents and discusses the trajectories of resource consumption and its conversion into useful work and environmental emissions from economic activities. The results show a significant increase in the country's metabolism as it evolved from a controlled to a more open free-market economy, along with a more recent and gradual improvement in the intensity of exergy use. Comparing the trend of India's metabolism with that of selected developing and developed economies shows India's path to be similar in many ways. Reliance on nonrenewable resources has been increasing and a large fraction of the exergy input gets wasted, as shown by a Grassmann diagram. Results show that opportunities exist for improving efficiency in the utilities and residential sectors. India needs to improve its efficiency at a faster rate than what happened in developed countries since otherwise the global implications due to fast economic growth and a large population can be quite significant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Developing economy; Exergy; National metabolism; Second law efficiency","Developing countries; Efficiency; Exergy; Metabolism; Physiology; Planning; Population statistics; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Developing economies; Environmental emissions; Improving efficiency; Non-renewable resource; Residential sectors; Resource consumption; Resource utilizations; Second law efficiencies; Economics; developing world; economic development; economic growth; energy efficiency; energy market; energy use; exergy; market conditions; nonrenewable resource; resource use; sustainability; sustainable development; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028979047

However, the capacity of ecosystems to supply these demands is routinely ignored, leading to decisions that overburden ecological processes and cause environmental damage. This work develops a techno-ecological synergy (TES) design methodology that balances the ecosystem services that can be provided by nature with the ecosystem service demands created by human activities. The methodology includes the design of technological processes that require ecosystem services as well as the ecological processes that supply those services. The TES Design methodology is demonstrated by application to a renewable energy production system that includes both land use activities, such as agriculture and wind turbines, and biomass conversion activities such as corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel. Under TES Design, the system is optimized to balance the demand and supply of ecosystem services, within constraints imposed on energy production and system economics. The system is also optimized under a more conventional approach that reduces ecosystem service demand while neglecting ecosystem service supply and the relevant ecological processes. Results show that only the TES methodology produces system designs in which ecosystem service supply meets or exceeds the demand. TES system designs produce the same amount of energy as conventional designs, have similar system economics, and use land both for energy production and for ecosystem service supply. The additional supply enables the use of intensive agricultural practices with higher ecosystem service demands and higher biomass yields. These results encourage further efforts toward TES Design with additional ecosystem services. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Land use trade-offs; Renewable energy; Sustainability","Agriculture; Bioconversion; Commerce; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Land use; Mergers and acquisitions; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Wind turbines; Agricultural practices; Conventional approach; Conventional design; Ecosystem services; Environmental damage; Renewable energies; Technological process; Trade off; Ecosystems; agricultural practice; bioenergy; biofuel; ecosystem service; environmental economics; environmental management; ethanol; land use; maize; power generation; production system; renewable resource; soybean; sustainability; trade-environment relations; trade-off; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018778667

Previous studies convey the benefits of such technologies, but most do not consider the waste and environmental conditions in tropical megacities such as Mumbai, India, making these studies of limited use to developing countries. This article evaluates the exergetic potential of converting MSW to useful work by thermal and biochemical conversion technologies in the Indian context, considering the facts that the scale of production, composition, climate, segregation practices, moisture content of MSW, etc. in a developing tropical country like India differ significantly from those in developed societies in temperate climate locations.

Many input–output analyses are based on a single period analysis. However, in the case of analyzing the effects of multiple policy interventions over time, the input–output table reflecting the state of the economy before the energy policy was introduced cannot be used for analyzing the economic effects of another policy intervention in the next time period since the monetary and physical transaction of commodities have already been affected. To show the efficacy of the proposed method, a case study is developed that introduced a gasoline tax and earmarks the revenues to subsidize biofuel production in the subsequent time period in the United States. In order to assess the change of environmental indicators after sequential policy interventions, Ecologically-based Life Cycle Analysis (ECO-LCA) inventories which include data on resource consumption, emissions, ecosystem goods and services related to the U.S. economic sectors are adopted. The environmentally extended input–output framework is ideally suited to model the interlinkages between a range for environmental indicators and detailed structural economic information at the sector level for the analysis of energy policies. The proposed framework can be utilized as a tool for leveraging the energy and environmental policy trade-off decisions which consider the impacts to resource consumption and environmental emissions. Our results show that, if a share of the gasoline tax revenue is reinvested to subsidize biofuel production, economy wide resource consumptions and emissions from the fossil fuel related supply chains will decrease. However, ecosystem goods and services such as soil erosion, water consumption for agricultural and livestock, cropland, nitrogen deposition along with the emissions such as nitrous oxide and ammonia will increase in short term as a consequence of the price drop and the increased demand for biofuels. This emphasizes the importance of focusing on a wide range of environmental outcomes and unintended side effects when introducing a specific environmental policy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuel subsidies; Ecosystem goods and services; Emissions; Gasoline tax; Resource consumptions; Sequential economic input–output analysis","Agriculture; Alternative fuels; Biofuels; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Ecosystems; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Fuels; Gasoline; Life cycle; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Supply chains; Taxation; Economic input/ output analysis; Environmental emissions; Environmental implications; Environmental indicators; Environmental outcome; Gasoline tax; Input output analysis; Resource consumption; Economic analysis; alternative fuel; ammonia; biofuel; emission control; energy policy; environmental policy; input-output analysis; nitrous oxide; pollution tax; resource use; subsidy system; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969941360

Analogous to economic systems, ecological systems also include limits on the stocks of ecosystems goods and services. These can include limits on the availability of ecological resources like fossil fuels, minerals, biomass, fiber and feed, as well as limits on the provisioning of ecosystem services like carbon sequestration, water provisioning, nutrient cycling etc. Ignoring these limits while designing systems have resulted in several unintended consequences, resulting in ecological degradation. For instance, switching farming practices to more intensive agricultural habits to increase crop yield has resulted in harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie due to fertilizer runoff from farms. In the engineering context, the main focus of conventional design has been to maximize profitability while simultaneously minimizing environmental impacts. Accounting for the role of nature in engineering has been confined to ideas like Biomimicry [1] and Eco-technology [2] such as the use of wetlands for water treatment. However, these methods lack proper integration with concepts of engineering design and such methods do not necessarily identify possible synergies and trade-offs that exist between engineered systems and nature. In addition, all these approaches also neglect the ecological carrying capacity, thus resulting in an increase in disparity between the demand for ecological goods and services and their supply from nature. The Techno-Ecological Synergy (TES) framework [3] was developed to account for the carrying capacity of ecosystems by quantifying the demand and supply of ecosystem services (ES). Resource inputs for operating engineering systems creates a demand for ecological goods while the emissions, waste and wastewater generated by engineering systems creates a demand for ecosystem services. The supply of ecosystem goods and services is based on the capacity of an ecological system, in the vicinity of an engineering system to provide the necessary ES demanded by the process. The sustainability index for this framework is based on the difference in the supply and demand for ES. This work integrates the TES framework with concepts of engineering design, resulting in the design of integrated Techno-Ecological systems. The TES design framework accounts for both demand and supply of ecosystem services while designing systems and the objective is to maximize profitability and minimize the disparity between the demand and supply of ES. Thus, the problem focuses on reducing both demand and increasing supply by preservation and restoration of ecological systems, in contrast to conventional approaches of merely minimizing demand. The presentation conveys the significance of including the role of nature in supporting engineering design. This is indicated by demonstrating that including nature in the design problem expands the solution space of conventional engineering design resulting in the identification of plausible ""win-win"" scenarios. Design problems are formulated as multi-objective optimization problems, with the objective of maximizing the economic value of the system and maximizing the sustainability index. Trade-offs between these objectives are identified by scalarizing multiple objectives using the epsilon constraint methods. Tradeoff designs are obtained for different ecosystem services, depending on the type of service relevant to the system of interest and the spatial presence of ecological systems. Four diverse case studies are discussed to demonstrate the significance of including nature in engineering. The first study describes the design of a residential system accounting for ecosystems like trees, lawn and a vegetable garden. While designing a residential systems, technological, ecological and behavioural variables are considered in the design. The objectives are to minimize both the cost compared to basecase and carbon emission. The problem is formulated as a simulation-based Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) using EnergyPlus as the simulation engine. The second study discusses the design of a biosolids network flow system along with the design of ecological systems that supply carbon sequestration ecosystem services, like timberland, forest lands and geological sequestration. Superstructure of possible biosolid flow pathways along with possible pathways for carbon sequestration are identified, and optimal designs of these coupled Techno-Ecological networks are determined by minimizing the network cost and minimizing the difference between carbon sequestration service demand and supply. The entire problem is formulated and solved as a MILP in the Eco-Flow tool. In addition, feedback from ecosystems in terms of biomass from timberland is considered as a feedstock for supplying energy to the wastewater treatment sites. Third study describes the benefits of including ecosystems in a process engineering design context whereby ecological systems are included in engineering design analogous to unit operations. An integrated design of a biofuel system with a wetland ecosystem is discussed wherein the system is design to maximize provisioning of ecosystem services like water provisioning service and water quality regulation service, while maximizing the net present value. The problem is formulated as an Non Linear Program implemented in GAMS. The last study focuses on designing agricultural landscapes for producing energy and food, while accounting for services provided by agro-ecosystems. These services include carbon sequestration, water provisioning, and others. The trade-off between monetary objectives and costs are evaluated for various biofuel production alternatives. Non-inferior pareto frontiers are generated for each ecosystem service for all case studies. Results indicate that including ecological variables in the design results in possible solutions that do not exist in the techno-centric solution space of conventional engineering methods. In addition to this, accounting feedback flows from ecosystems in terms of ecological goods shifts the Pareto frontier to a new range, revealing innovative and novel design solutions. These new solutions obtained from including ecological systems are economically superior compared to conventional solutions; they also have environmental benefits in terms of reduced overshoot.

Conventional SPD involves a â €œbottom up approachâ€ of modeling the system of interest at a smaller scale with detailed process specific fundamental engineering models, while the upstream life cycle of the product is modeled at a larger scale using process based LCA. System boundary selection is a significant challenge for process LCA due to Â infinite nature of the upstream life cycle network for any process [1]. Process based LCA can lead to significant truncation errors in life cycle resource consumption and emissions, leaving a wide margin for shifting of impacts across narrow system boundaries and leading to illusive optimal design solutions that may in fact be inferior due to incomplete life cycle information [2]. Hybrid LCA(HLCA) methods aim to address the boundary selection problem by combining process level life cycle inventories with environmentally extended input-output analysis(EEIO), which allows for a significant part of the product life cycle to be included in the assessment. The Process to Planet (P2P) framework [3] was developed by introducing the concept of integrated hybrid LCA [4] to SPD. Detailed engineering models of the primary process being designed and other key processes in the supply chain are integrated within a macroeconomic system represented by economic input-output (EIO) model. This ensures solution of process design problems while reducing chances of environmental impacts being neglected due to incomplete life cycle inventories. While bridging the knowledge gap between PSE and LCA, the P2P framework not only improves upon the life cycle assessment component of SPD, but also addresses a major weakness in Hybrid LCA. HLCA is limited to the impact assessment stage of life cycle assessment. Very few studies have dealt with the fourth and final stage of LCA, improvement analysis. This situation is lamentable because inventory scope and impact analysis provide little benefit if not followed by recommendations and decisions that should be adopted to reduce environmental burden. The P2P framework can be visualized as an extension of HLCA method where it enables the incorporation of design variables through process design and allows optimization of the system to improve its environmental footprint. It was successfully demonstrated by application to a corn based ethanol production plant and highly insightful results were obtained that proved the efficacy of the framework [2]. This presentation proposes extensions and modifications that address some of the inadequacies that are inherent in the original P2P framework. While strictly applied to P2P, these extensions can be extrapolated to answer challenges that exist in broad areas of literature, like HLCA. The selection of significant processes that are modeled at the process based life cycle scale and the insignificant processes that are studied at the economy scale is arbitrary. In other words, delineation of the boundary between the different scales of the P2P framework was a subjective task. Previously, this was done based on data availability, accuracy and detail requirements and the complexity of the overall problem which is proportional to the solving time [5,6]. The problem was first mentioned and some methods were proposed for addressing it in a paper by Suh [7]. Lenzen proposed Structural Path Analysis (SPA) involving the decomposition of the Leontief Inverse for addressing this problem [8]. Treloar also used this method to study energy use of individual residential buildings in Australia [9,10]. Lave et al. [11] and Lenzen [12] used SPA to quantify the truncation errors in process-based LCA. A path exchange method using SPA was also developed as an alternative to the method of combining process LCA and IO LCA within integrated hybrid LCA as proposed by Suh. We intend to address this knowledge gap by proposing a path analysis algorithm where the P2P framework superstructure model generation is guided by a hierarchical structural path decomposition method which determines the coverage of the different scales. It is one of the first applications of SPA for solving the boundary selection problem involving the distribution of different upstream processes between multiple scales. A large number of studies have dealt with multi objective optimization in process design and energy systems involving environmental and economic impacts. A comprehensive list of such literature can be found in Diwekar et al.[13] Reviewing these articles, it becomes apparent that it is necessary to simultaneously work towards both economic profitability and environmental sustainability of the system. Previously, the P2P framework focused only on the environmental dimension of process design. In this work, we propose a multi objective optimization problem, involving the trade-off between an economic objective and an environmental objective function. The novelty in this addendum is that it makes the P2P framework more fruitful for designing any generic process while exercising control over both the economic and environmental scope. Preliminary results have provided insightful views on the application of SPA algorithm for model generation as well as exposed existing deficiencies to work on. While SPA is successful in mapping the upstream networks of the process to be designed and calculate their contributions to the entire life cycle, the quantification of the quality of the generated model still needs to be addressed. For example, considering two scenarios where an upstream sector is modeled at the IO model scale and process LCA scale respectively, we need to develop parameters that can quantitatively compare between the two cases and rank them objectively. As of now, subjective decisions are being used to build the model, but we intend to develop an algorithm based on error analysis or uncertainty information to determine the model quality. Multiobjective optimization solutions demonstrated that, highly erroneous optimal solutions and counter intuitive results are obtained from practicing conventional SPD approach rather than P2P. In addition to this, it was observed that there is a 59% chance of choosing an inferior solution over the optimal solution when solving the design problem using conventional SPD.

Conventional SPD involves a â ""bottom up approacha"" of modeling the system of interest at a smaller scale with detailed process specific fundamental engineering models, while the upstream life cycle of the product is modeled at a larger scale using process based LCA. System boundary selection is a significant challenge for process LCA due toÂ infinite nature of the upstream life cycle network for any process [1]. Process based LCA can lead to significant truncation errors in life cycle resource consumption and emissions, leaving a wide margin for shifting of impacts across narrow system boundaries and leading to illusive optimal design solutions that may in fact be inferior due to incomplete life cycle information [2]. Hybrid LCA(HLCA) methods aim to address the boundary selection problem by combining process level life cycle inventories with environmentally extended input-output analysis(EEIO), which allows for a significant part of the product life cycle to be included in the assessment. The Process to Planet (P2P) framework [3] was developed by introducing the concept of integrated hybrid LCA [4] to SPD. Detailed engineering models of the primary process being designed and other key processes in the supply chain are integrated within a macroeconomic system represented by economic input-output (EIO) model. This ensures solution of process design problems while reducing chances of environmental impacts being neglected due to incomplete life cycle inventories. While bridging the knowledge gap between PSE and LCA, the P2P framework not only improves upon the life cycle assessment component of SPD, but also addresses a major weakness in Hybrid LCA.

Failure to maintain adequate animal-mediated pollination service to support increasing demand for pollination-dependent crops poses risks for the U.S. economy. We integrate the Economic Input-Output (EIO) model and network analysis with data on pollinator dependence of crops to understand the economic dependence of U.S. industrial sectors on animal-mediated pollination service. The novelty of this work lies in its ability to identify industrial sectors and industrial communities (groups of closely linked sectors) that are most vulnerable to scarcity of pollination service provided by various animal species. While the economic dependence of agricultural sectors on pollination service is significant (US14.2-23.8 billion), the higher-order economic dependence of the rest of the U.S. industrial sectors is substantially high as well (US10.3-21.1 billion).

Energy is a critical input for socio-economic development, and its strategy aims at efficiency and security. To provide access to environmentally friendly energy resources, the national biofuel policy targets cellulosic feedstocks which necessitates analysing feedstocks using holistic approaches. This paper studies the life cycle impact of ethanol production from cellulosic agricultural feedstocks. Methods: The difficulty of finding appropriate life cycle inventory data for the analysed biofuels in the Indian context is overcome by combining data from diverse sources such as journal articles, government reports and personal contact with farmers. Variation in these numbers across studies is captured by means of error bars. These data are used to calculate environmental sustainability metrics such as energy return on investment, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and life cycle water use for each fuel. Biomass sources considered in this work include cellulose from wheat stalk, rice husk, sorghum stalk, sugarcane bagasse and cotton stalk. These results are compared with ethanol from molasses and sugarcane juice, which are the conventional approaches. Results and discussion: Results of the analysis indicate that sorghum stalk is most attractive due to its high energy return on investment, low greenhouse gas emissions, and low water and land use. Ethanol from rice husk has relatively high water use and greenhouse gas emissions, but these are within the margin of variability of other fuels. Despite the attractiveness of sorghum stalk from the current analysis, it is not likely that this will become a major feedstock for cellulosic ethanol in India. This is because farmers value sorghum as an animal feed and may not be willing to convert it into ethanol. Conclusions: This is the first life cycle study of Indian cellulosic biofuel pathways. The inventory data collected in this work is a novel contribution that should be useful for other studies. Findings from the analysis can help guide the decision-making process in the biofuel sector for India. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Developing countries; Energy return on investment; Ethanol; India; Lignocellulose","bagasse; cellulose; alcohol production; Article; biomass energy; biomass production; carbon footprint; controlled study; crop; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; Gossypium; greenhouse gas; India; irrigation (agriculture); land use; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; plant stem; priority journal; rice husk; sorghum; sugarcane; wheat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947488259

One approach to allocation is to partition the embodied resources in proportion to a criterion, such as product mass or cost. Many practitioners apply multiple partitioning criteria to avoid choosing one arbitrarily. However, life cycle results from different allocation methods frequently contradict each other, making it difficult or impossible for the practitioner to draw any meaningful conclusions from the study. Using the matrix notation for life-cycle inventory data, we show that an inventory that requires allocation leads to an ill-posed problem: an inventory based on allocation is one of an infinite number of inventories that are highly dependent upon allocation methods. This insight is applied to comparative life-cycle assessment (LCA), in which products with the same function but different life cycles are compared. Recently, there have been several studies that applied multiple allocation methods and found that different products were preferred under different methods. We develop the Comprehensive Allocation Investigation Strategy (CAIS) to examine any given inventory under all possible allocation decisions, enabling us to detect comparisons that are not robust to allocation, even when the comparison appears robust under conventional partitioning methods. While CAIS does not solve the ill-posed problem, it provides a systematic way to parametrize and examine the effects of partitioning allocation. The practical usefulness of this approach is demonstrated with two case studies. The first compares ethanol produced from corn stover hydrolysis, corn stover gasification, and corn grain fermentation. This comparison was not robust to allocation. The second case study compares 1,3-propanediol (PDO) produced from fossil fuels and from biomass, which was found to be a robust comparison.

We also calculate cost of electricity generation by each of these technologies. The resulting information is utilized to determine the optimum energy mix to meet the energy demand in Rampura Village, Uttar Pradesh, India by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. The LP problem is processed in two steps: first, it is solved for four scenarios involving different practical situations and constraints. After determining the suitable scenario, the optimum energy combination within this scenario is found.The scenario and energy combination analyses reveal that performing 70% of cooking by biogas cook stoves, 30% by improved biomass cook stoves in the traditional way, and converting rest of biogas to electricity to meet irrigation and lighting energy needs is the most environmentally benign, economically feasible and socially attractive option for the village. Direct utilization of biogas for cooking makes it possible to meet all the energy demand in Rampura with local resources. Importing energy from erratic and unreliable government grid is not needed, hence energy security and reliability are ensured. Additionally, the GHG and other emissions related to cooking with inefficient stoves are also significantly mitigated (88%) through the use of biogas and improved biomass cook stoves.Energy projection through 2031 to determine changing energy patterns in the project site shows that there will be enough biogas for cooking needs in Rampura until 2031. However, by 2016, the total energy demand (cooking. +. irrigation. +. lighting) will exceed what can be met with only biogas. Then either biogas potential will need to increase or electricity will have to come from biomass or solar resources. If these local sources of energy are not enough, importing energy from centralized energy options will be necessary. Thus, increasing energy demand in developing countries will necessitate utilization of centralized energy options even in rural areas. Utilizing centralized clean coal technologies to meet this demand could ease energy related environmental problems. Alternatively, if rural development can take place without rampant consumerism and energy-intensive lifestyles, then satisfying local needs with local resources with minimum environmental impact is much more likely. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Clean coal; Developing countries; Emergy; Energy technologies; Life cycle assessment; Renewable energy","Biogas; Biomass; Coal; Developing countries; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy security; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Lighting; Linear programming; Regional planning; Rural areas; Clean coal; Emergy; Energy technologies; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renewable energies; Life cycle; biogas; biomass; coal; developing world; electricity generation; emergy; energy resource; environmental impact; feasibility study; life cycle; performance assessment; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927581883

Most methods account for the demand for ecosystem services, but almost none account for the supply. Incomplete accounting of the very foundation of human well-being can result in perverse outcomes from decisions meant to enhance sustainability and lost opportunities for benefiting from the ability of nature to satisfy human needs in an economically and environmentally superior manner. This paper develops a framework for understanding and designing synergies between technological and ecological systems to encourage greater harmony between human activities and nature. This framework considers technological systems ranging from individual processes to supply chains and life cycles, along with corresponding ecological systems at multiple spatial scales ranging from local to global. The demand for specific ecosystem services is determined from information about emissions and resource use, while the supply is obtained from information about the capacity of relevant ecosystems. Metrics calculate the sustainability of individual ecosystem services at multiple spatial scales and help define necessary but not sufficient conditions for local and global sustainability. Efforts to reduce ecological overshoot encourage enhancement of life cycle efficiency, development of industrial symbiosis, innovative designs and policies, and ecological restoration, thus combining the best features of many existing methods.

Comprehensive models for sustainable engineering may be developed by combining models at multiple scales. Models at the finest ""equipment"" scale are engineering models based on fundamental knowledge. At the intermediate ""value chain"" scale, empirical models represent average production technologies, and at the coarsest ""economy"" scale, models represent monetary and environmental exchanges for industrial sectors in a national or global economy. However, existing methods for sustainable engineering design ignore the economy scale, while existing methods for life cycle assessment do not consider the equipment scale. This work proposes an integrated, multiscale modeling framework for connecting models from process to planet and using them for sustainable engineering applications. The proposed framework is demonstrated with a toy problem, and potential applications of the framework including current and future work are discussed. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Design; Mathematical modeling; Multiscale modeling; Optimization; Sustainability","Design; Economics; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Mathematical models; Optimization; Comprehensive model; Connected systems; Engineering decisions; Engineering models; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multi-scale Modeling; Production technology; Sustainable engineering; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940797252

While SPD makes use of recent advances in process systems engineering and optimization, its use of LCA has stagnated. Currently, only process LCA is utilized in SPD, resulting in designs based on incomplete and potentially inaccurate life cycle information. To address these shortcomings, the multiscale process to planet (P2P) modeling framework is applied to formulate and solve the SPD problem. The P2P framework offers a more comprehensive analysis boundary than conventional SPD and greater modeling detail than advanced LCA methodologies. Benefits of applying this framework to SPD are demonstrated with an ethanol process design case study. Results show that current methods shift emissions outside the analysis boundary, while applying the P2P modeling framework results in environmentally superior process designs. Future extensions of the P2P framework are discussed. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Design; Green engineering; Optimization; Process; Simulation","Design; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Optimization; Problem solving; Processing; Comprehensive analysis; Design case studies; Green engineering; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle environmental impact; Life-cycle information; Simulation; Sustainable process; Process design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940784749

A toy supply chain design problem is used to compare the proposed multiscale modeling framework to a standard SPD approach. The multiscale framework is shown to lead to supply chain designs that have reduced emissions and slightly increased production cost compared to designs obtained using the standard approach.

Several metrics in use are developed from a narrow viewpoint of only looking at the output side impact of human activities on natural systems. This underestimates or overlooks other impacts on natural systems that occur due to input side interaction of human systems with natural systems. We revisit the paradigms used for development of footprint metrics and analyze the carbon and nitrogen footprints from these perspectives. Based on our analysis, utilizing both input and output side footprint measures is suggested such that heterogeneity of the nature of impact on both sides is not ignored. Utilizing these viewpoints, updated carbon and nitrogen footprints are proposed. Eco-LCA data for 2002 US economy is used to study the effect on decisions if these updated metrics are used. We also highlight the importance of understanding the multidimensional nature of environmental impacts that does not get captured by a single footprint, thus necessitating attention to the nexus of various footprints in decision making. Thus, the nexus between the updated carbon and nitrogen metrics is studied to show the shift in decisions resulting from looking at multidimensional impacts. Results for the US economy show that revisiting the paradigm for development of footprint metrics is a crucial step to avoid pushing decisions in incorrect directions due to use of narrowly focused footprint measures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This article develops a model that integrates the carbon cycle with economic activities in the 2002 U.S. economy. Data about the carbon cycle, including emissions and sequestration flows, is obtained from the greenhouse gas inventory of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Economic activities are captured by the economic input-output model available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The resulting model is more comprehensive in its accounting for the carbon cycle than existing methods for carbon footprint (CF) calculations. Examples of unique flows in this model include the effect of land-use and land-cover change on carbon dioxide flow within the U.S. national boundary, carbon sequestration in urban trees, and emissions resulting from liming. This model is used to gain unique insight into the carbon profile of U.S. economic sectors by providing the life cycle emissions and sequestration in each sector. Such insight may be used to support policies, manage supply chains, and be used for more comprehensive CF calculations. © 2014 by Yale University.","Biogeochemical cycles; Carbon; Ecosystem services; Industrial ecology; Input-output models; Life cycle assessment (LCA)","Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Ecosystems; Environmental Protection Agency; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Biogeochemical cycle; Ecosystem services; Industrial ecology; Input output model; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Economic analysis; Carbon; Ecology; Emission; Evaluation; Life Cycle; Models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916631459

These I-O-based results are also compared with those from process LCA databases. The underlying approach is based on the theoretical insight previously developed. The results show significant differences and offer useful heuristic insight: The survey-based data set seems better for sectors that use a large amount of resources and have large intrasectoral transactions. But, it exhibits many missing values. Homogeneous price-based calculation with supply-side data is easiest because of minimal data needs and simplifying assumption on prices. The result shows relatively complete coverage and obeys mass and energy balances. The heterogeneous price-based data set overcomes the price homogeneity assumption, but the result is sensitive to price accuracy. Overall, it is not possible to declare any currently available data sets to be the best, although survey- and heterogeneous price-based data sets may be improved with more information. This insight is based on comparing direct consumption of fossil resources. Comparison of cumulative consumption reduces the disparities among data sets from error cancellation. Further comparison of process- and I-O-based inventories shows that the former values are often larger than the latter, with the two supply-side data sets being closer to process-based data. These results should be useful for choosing between available data to build the best possible I-O and hybrid LCA models and for further research on enhancing their quality. © 2014, Yale University.","Cumulative energy consumption; Industrial ecology; Input-output model; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Resource accounting; Uncertainty analysis","Costs; Energy utilization; Surveys; Uncertainty analysis; Cumulative energy consumption; Industrial ecology; Input output model; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Resource accountings; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907887461

Guidance in favor of single-use cups rely on outdated or non-ISO-compliant results with limited uncertainty information. Such claims are insufficiently generalizable. This article delivers an updated comparative life cycle impact assessment of reusable ceramic cups and single-use expanded polystyrene cups. Methods: The ReCiPe midpoint model was selected. Scenario uncertainties are addressed by evaluating compliant standard dishwashing appliance models from 2004 to 2013 used in 26 US subregional utility grids. A utility snapshot from 2009 is applied with extension to recent shifts in generation from increased penetration of natural gas and renewable energy. Parameter uncertainty is quantified through statistical methods. Results: Where there is statistical difference, results almost entirely favor reusable cups in the USA. For climate change, 16 % of users have higher impact for ceramic cups washed in 2013 by minimally compliant dishwashers. Higher climate change impacts for 32 % of reusable cup users is indicated with 2004 average dishwashers, though using a cup twice between washes shifts the impact in favor of the reusable cup. Conclusions: Disposable cup scenarios do not account for film sleeves, lids, printing, and less conservative shipping weights and distances and therefore reflect a best case scenario. Impact for reusable cups is expected to decrease further as the electricity mix becomes less CO2- intensive with replacement of coal-fired generators by natural gas, wind, and solar and as less efficient dishwashers are replaced with new units compliant to current laws. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Consumer choice; Midpoint impact assessment; Sustainability; Uncertainty","article; bioenergy; ceramic industry; climate change; consumer; decision making; dishwashing appliance model; disposable cup; electricity; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; gas turbine power; general device; human; land use; life cycle assessment; packaging; plastic industry; priority journal; process model; ReCiPe midpoint model; renewable energy; reusable cup; traffic and transport; uncertainty; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899069083

The presence of a sustainable, safe and dependable source of freshwater and renewable energy is very important to society. Microbial Desalination Cells (MDCs) provide a source of desalinated water and create electricity as a byproduct. With the improvement in this technology, MDCs can be assembled and maintained with minimal impact to the environment. This project explores the use of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the sustainable adoption of a MDC as a desalination device. The results from this project can provide stakeholders with a holistic view of implementing MDCs in the real world, and their impact on the environment. Conducting a life cycle analysis provides substantial evidence to prove or disprove the long term environmental viability of using MDCs for desalination. A comparison with other researched desalination techniques, especially reverse osmosis, can provide a good argument for the use of MDCs. The LCA analysis can be used to persuade policymakers and investors to continue the development and implementation of MDCs for society's benefit.",,"Desalination; Sustainable development; Water filtration; Desalinated water; Holistic view; Impact on the environment; Life cycle analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Microbial desalination cells; Policy makers; Renewable energies; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911462293

(Int. J. Life Cycle Assess. 15:1020-1040, 2010)). These methods are placed within the context of traditional methods of partitioning allocation. An equivalence between least squares techniques and traditional partitioning is noted and demonstrated on previously published brick production data.Materials and methods: A short summary of the relevant least squares techniques is provided followed by a description of the problem of inventory calculation for the case of more products than processes. This is presented in terms of non-unique solutions to underdetermined systems of linear equations with intensity matrix as unknown.Results and discussion: We provide another analysis of the Sicilian brick production case study. Upon reexamination of the brick data, a number of disparities in the published inventories for brick can be more fully explained in terms of (1) data quality, (2) additional assumptions made to extract a solution of an underdetermined system of equations, and (3) discrepancy vectors.Conclusions and outlook: Like other types of partitioning, inventories produced by least squares techniques correspond to one of the non-unique solutions of an underdetermined system of linear equations. Based on this insight, we advise against the use of least squares techniques as a black-box approach to the allocation problem and conclude that the recommendation of TLS on the basis of its asymptotic properties is not theoretically justified. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Allocation; Least squares; Matrix-based LCI; Partitioning; Regression","Article; brick; calculation; controlled study; data least squares; data quality; information; life cycle assessment; materials; mathematical analysis; mathematical phenomena; ordinary least squares; partitioning allocation; regression analysis; total least squares",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911400062

It will be shown that each of the existing partitioning methods arrives at just one particular solution from among infinitely many solutions of an underdetermined system of linear equations.Materials and methods: Some life cycle inventories fall into a class of functions called estimable functions in linear model framework, in which case they are invariant to allocation assumptions. This class of functions unites results described by Heijungs and Frischknecht (Int J Life Cycle Assess 3:321–332, 1998) and Heijungs and Suh (2002, Conjecture 1, p. 91). The inventories for non-estimable functions obtained through allocation are, in fact, derived under a set of additional implicit equality constraints called side conditions, often resulting in inventory results which differ greatly from one allocation to the next.Results and discussions: This paper explicates (1) identification of all estimable functions from any given technology matrix and (2) recovery of side conditions imposed on non-estimable functions through partitioning. These methods are illustrated in a simple example, and their relation to least squares techniques for allocation explored by Marvuglia et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess 15:1020–1040, 2010) ;(Int J Agr Environ Inf Syst 3:51–71, 2012) are discussed.Conclusions and outlook: Recommendations are made that may lead to more meaningful ways to obtain additional data or include additional information in life cycle inventories in the future. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Allocation; Life cycle inventory; Linear equations; Matrix based LCI","Article; calculation; life cycle assessment; linear system; mathematical computing; parametric test; partition coefficient; partitioning allocation method; problem solving; statistical concepts; statistical distribution; theory; validation process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910106909

An integrated economic-environmental assessment framework couples the measured emission impacts from the fuels with individuals' preferences regarding each fuel's externalities. This framework allows the welfare values associated with gasoline and ethanol's externalities to be derived and compared. The results of the study reveal that the production and consumption of corn starch ethanol produce declines in environmental and health outcomes of $1.23 per gallon relative to gasoline for an 85% blend. Depending on the feedstock source, cellulosic based ethanol blends produce modest gains in environmental and health outcomes valued at between $0.04 and $0.06 per gallon relative to gasoline. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuels; Ecological indicators; Ethanol; Fuel externalities; Willingness-to-pay","alternative fuel; biofuel; biomass; cellulose; emission inventory; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; environmental indicator; ethanol; health risk; industrial production; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; maize; risk assessment; valuation; welfare economics; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899577016

In recent years, a number of modeling approaches have been developed to support the engineering and decision-making processes associated with the development and implementation of a sustainable biochemical industry. The temporal and spatial scales of modeling approaches for sustainable chemical production vary greatly, ranging from metabolic models that aid the design of fermentative microbial strains to material and monetary flow models that explore the ecological impacts of all economic activities. Research efforts that attempt to connect the models at different scales have been limited. Here, we review a number of existing modeling approaches and their applications at the scales of metabolism, bioreactor, overall process, chemical industry, economy, and ecosystem. In addition, we propose a multi-scale approach for integrating the existing models into a cohesive framework. The major benefit of this proposed framework is that the design and decision-making at each scale can be informed, guided, and constrained by simulations and predictions at every other scale. In addition, the development of this multi-scale framework would promote cohesive collaborations across multiple traditionally disconnected modeling disciplines to achieve sustainable chemical production. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This has encouraged significant anthropogenic mobilization of reactive nitrogen and its emissions into the environment resulting in severe disruption of the nitrogen cycle. This paper incorporates the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen into the 2002 input-output model of the U.S. economy. Due to the complexity of this cycle, this work proposes a unique classification of nitrogen flows to facilitate understanding of the interaction between economic activities and various flows in the nitrogen cycle. The classification scheme distinguishes between the mobilization of inert nitrogen into its reactive form, use of nitrogen in various products, and nitrogen losses to the environment. The resulting inventory and model of the US economy can help quantify the direct and indirect impacts or dependence of economic sectors on the nitrogen cycle. This paper emphasizes the need for methods to manage the N cycle that focus not just on N losses, which has been the norm until now, but also include other N flows for a more comprehensive view and balanced decisions. Insight into the N profile of various sectors of the 2002 U.S. economy is presented, and the inventory can also be used for LCA or Hybrid LCA of various products.

This work explicitly accounts for this dependence by designing synergies between technological and ecological systems. The resulting techno-ecological network mimics nature at the systems level, can stay within ecological constraints, and can identify novel designs that are economically and environmentally attractive that may not be found by the traditional design focus on technological options. This approach is showcased by designing synergies for a typical American suburban home at local and life cycle scales. The objectives considered are carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and cost savings. Systems included in the design optimization include typical ecosystems in suburban yards: lawn, trees, water reservoirs, and a vegetable garden; technological systems: heating, air conditioning, faucets, solar panels, etc.; and behavioral variables: heating and cooling set points. The ecological and behavioral design variables are found to have a significant effect on the three objectives, in some cases rivaling and exceeding the effect of traditional technological options. These results indicate the importance and benefits of explicitly including ecosystems in the design of sustainable systems, something that is rarely done in existing methods. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon emissions; Cost saving; Design optimization; Design variables; Ecological systems; Ecosystem services; Heating and cooling; North American; Novel design; Residential systems; Solar panels; Sustainable systems; Systems levels; Technological system; Water withdrawal; Design; Ecosystems; Mergers and acquisitions; Optimization; Thermal processing (foods); Water supply; Cooling systems; ecosystem service; life cycle analysis; residential energy; suburban area; sustainability; synergism; technology adoption; air conditioning; article; behavior; carbon footprint; cost control; ecosystem; water supply; Carbon Footprint; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Housing; Water Supply; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874094090

We provide counter examples to the claims made therein, point out the key error in their proof and identify correct sufficient conditions under which the largest (smallest) values of the given α-cuts of fuzzy numbers in the technology matrix yield the smallest (largest) scaling factors. Methods: HT uses iterative perturbations of a matrix to seemingly provide a rigorous proof of this result. Flaws in their arguments are identified and demonstrated by way of a counterexample. A classical result on monotonic property of the inverse of M-matrices leads to the correct sufficient conditions under which HT result holds. Results: Since counter examples can be found, the result stated in HT is not, in general, guaranteed. Conclusions: As claimed in the HT paper, checking the upper and lower bounds of α-cuts may not be sufficient to describe the uncertainty (the full range of values) in the final inventory.

Since thermodynamics governs the behavior of all systems, it can play a crucial role in understanding fundamental physical limits of technologies and for quantifying the contribution of resources. The concept of exergy captures the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Since exergy is the common currency that flows and gets transformed in industrial and ecological systems, it allows the joint analysis of industrial and ecological systems. This insight permits accounting of the role of ecosystem goods and services in supporting human activities. Since ecosystems are critical to sustainability, accounting for their role must be a part of all methods aimed toward the analysis and design of sustainable systems. Thermodynamics provides a scientifically rigorous approach for meeting this challenge. In addition, exergy analysis of industrial processes and life cycles helps in identifying areas of maximum resource inefficiency and opportunities for improvement. This approach complements the insight obtained from assessing the impact of emissions. Case studies based on the life cycle of biofuels and nanomanufacturing are used to demonstrate the important role that thermodynamics can play in sustainability engineering. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

This talk will focus on the trends and opportunities for enhancing the energy and material efficiency of industrial sectors in India. It uses the approach of exergy analysis since it has been found to be an appropriate measure for resource accounting. Studies on industrial sectors have been carried out for several economies and the resulting insight can be used for identifying opportunities for enhancing resource use and reducing environmental impact. The aim of this work is to understand the metabolism of Industry sector of India as it has evolved from a controlled to a more open free market economy, and its implications for sustainable development. We analyzed various industries in India on the basis of, resource consumption and environmental pollution. We estimate second law efficiencies for various industries in India, including Chemical, Iron and steel, Fertilizer, cement, sugar and others. We also estimate the efficiency of the India's industry sector as a whole. Trends of resource consumption and its conversion into useful work are analyzed using exergy analysis and the results are compared with those of other developing and developed economies. In addition, using techniques of network analysis, opportunities for enhancing exergy efficiency are identified.",,"Developed economies; Developing economies; Emerging economies; Environmental pollutions; Exergy Analysis; Exergy efficiencies; Free market economy; Industrial sector; Industry sectors; Iron and steel; Material efficiency; Resource consumption; Resource efficiencies; Resource use; Second law efficiencies; Cement industry; Environmental impact; Exergy; Planning; Sustainable development; Economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871750505

However, many engineering analyses undervalue or completely ignore them. Some methods attempt to incorporate these elements, such as ecological footprint, monetary valuation, and conventional life cycle assessment (LCA), but the focus is on energy consumption and emissions, ignoring the crucial role of ecosystems. This chapter presents ecologically based LCA (Eco-LCA) to quantify the role of ecosystem goods and services in the life cycle. The thermodynamic properties of exergy and emergy allow for the conversion of many different units of ecosystem goods and services to the common basis of thermodynamic work, to allow aggregation and comparison of results from Eco-LCA. A case study compares different ecosystem services using exergy and emergy, and the different insights that can be obtained from each.

An energy and midpoint impact assessment was performed to gauge impacts of scaling production to blades 40 m and longer. Higher loadings force trade-offs in energy return on investment and midpoint impacts relative to the base case while remaining superior to thermoelectric power generation in these indicators. Energy-intensive production of CNFs forces impacts disproportionate to mass contribution. The polymer nanocomposite increases a 2 MW plant's global warming potential nearly 100% per kWh electricity generated with 5% CNF by mass in the blades if no increase in electrical output is realized. The relative scale of impact must be compensated by systematic improvements whether by deployment in higher potential zones or by increased life span; the trade-offs are expected to be significantly lessened with CNF manufacturing maturity. Significant challenges are faced in evaluating emerging technologies including uncertainty in future scenarios and process scaling.

The relative use intensity of natural resources encompassing land and ecosystem goods and services by cellulosic ethanol was estimated using the Eco-LCA framework. Despite being resource intensive compared to gasoline, cellulosic ethanol offers the possibility of a reduction in crude oil consumption by as much as 96%. Soil erosion and land area requirements can be sources of concern for cellulosic ethanol derived directly from managed agriculture. The analysis of two broad types of thermodynamic metrics, namely: various types of physical return on investment and a renewability index, which indicate competitiveness and sustainability of cellulosic ethanol, respectively, show that only ethanol from waste resources combines a favorable thermodynamic return on investment with a higher renewability index. However, the production potential of ethanol from waste resources is limited. This finding conveys a possible dilemma of biofuels: Combining high renewability, high thermodynamic return on investment, and large production capacity may remain elusive.

However, at relatively low mass percentages, CNFs can reinforce polymercomposites yielding significant improvements in properties such as mode-1delamination resistance, vibrational damping, tensile strength, fatigue resistance and Young's modulus. A new method termed ""pre-binding"" has been developed to reinforce polymer composites with CNFs at the interface of long fibers and resin. This method improves the manufacturability of large pieces with CNF-reinforced polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) by overcoming processing issues inherent to previous methods of PNC fabrication. Materials scientistsare considering use of this emerging material for wind turbine blade production to meet the demand for larger, more resilient utility-scale wind power plants. Wind energy converters (WECs)on-line today are a relatively new technology with installations of multi megawatt ratings having been introduced to the modern market only in the last 15-20 years. The largest 3-blade horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) rotor size in operation is 126 meters in diameter with generator ratings from 5 to 7 MW whilethe growing market is dominated by new installations from 1 to 3 MW. Apparent limits of fiberglass technology have been reached as rotor blades beyond about40 meters generally require some inclusion of carbon fiber to address stiffness and edgewise fatigue, which become critical at this length. The less dense carbon fiber also leads to a positive deviation in trends of weight to increasing size. Recent press releases communicate progress in R&amp;D formeeting industrial-governmental collaborative goals for 20 MW plants possibly by 2020 using available technologies with rotors expected to have diameters near 200 meters. In an even shorter timespan, numerous nanotechnology-enabled products have been introduced to the consumer market with over 1,300 manufacturer-identified products populating The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies consumer product inventory today. These products include automobile body parts with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for enabling online electrostatic painting and a personal water craft using nanomaterials for reinforcement of the polymer composite for a light weight, stronger material. While life cycle energy consumption of CNF-reinforced PNCs for use in automobile body panels has beene valuated, similar trends were not expected for life cycle energy in wind turbines due to differences in operational phase energy consumption. Also, previous assessments of PNCs have not considered the method of pre-binding, which uses acetone as a vessel for dispersion and distribution of the CNFs onto glass or carbon fiber matting. Preliminary studies that assumed replacement of polymer composite blade materials on a 2 MW and 5 MW plant with CNF pre-bound PNCs indicated a range of parameterization values under which the energy return on investment (EROI) would not decrease. These studies have been updated in a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) to include more relevant process information and have been extended to a mid point analysis using the CML and Traci methods to determine areas of focus for optimization. An energy analysis was extended to a 5 MW WEC using cumulative energy demand and power generation figures from published LCA literature. Impacts are reported per kilowatt-hour generation of electricity by the wind power plant and compared tothe base case, which is a 2 MW WEC in Middelgrund that is inventoried in the proprietary Eco invent database. In every feasible scenario, the EROI of wind power plants with the PNC blade material remained competitive to thermoelectric power generation, and life cycle water consumption remained favorable. Where CNF production was assumed to be based on benzene feedstock, energy analysis results were much more favorable than methane. Midpoint analysis, however, was assessed with methaneas the preferred hydrocarbon source for pyrolysis in nanofiber manufacture. Similar trends emerged under extension to the 5 MW system energy analysis. Assuming a mass contribution of CNFs that ranges from 1 to 5 % by weight of each blade, the overall mass of the nanomaterials is approximately 0.01-0.06% of the over all mass of the WEC system, yet there is direct correlation between the mass fraction of the nanomaterials to non trivial impacts per kWh compared to the base case. Where studies have shown manufacturing of virgin nanomaterials to be solvent-intensive, this study finds that the use phase of the nanomaterial, where CNFs are integrated into a product system, is highly solvent-intensive aswell. Current laboratory scale ratios of solvent spent to nanofibers dispersed are on the order of 5 × 10 2 g solvent per g CNF. Maturation of thismaterial development must include a reduction of solvent use by optimization ofthe dispersion process and evaluation of solvent recovery systems for reuse that considers effects of nanomaterials in the operation. Photochemical oxidation is a concern in terms of acetone emissions, the degree to which willbe dependent on recovery, reuse, and emissions controls. Also, the degree ofsolvent fresh feed required has an impact on the overall system's global warming potential and eutrophication potential due to the manufacturing phase of the acetone. Evaluating impacts of emerging technologies is complicated by the fast-pace of development and deployment, significant gaps in data and uncertainties about the future. Compilation of life cycle data is unwieldy at best due to complex supply chains and regional variations in categories as energy supply and transportation. This is further complicated by incomplete understanding of ecosystem service impacts, thoughwork is underway to quantify and compile ecosystem services for inclusion in LCA. System performance improvements will not occur with PNC integration in isolation of other technological changes within WEC design and operation, yet analyses as this are meant to give insight to areas of concern by identifying impacts and order of magnitude effects associated with this emerging material for the assumed use.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857226906

Environmental factors considered include energy use, water use, land use, and global warming potential (GWP) of the processes. CLP provides an integrated system for CO 2, sulfur, and halide separation using a modified CaO absorbent resulting in an emission free gasification process. However, the energy spent in the calciner unit for regeneration of the CaO sorbent reduces the process efficiency. CLP looks better from a GWP point of view. In process scale, CLP is an emission-free process whereas conventional process emits 1417.7 ton/yr of CO 2. Further process optimization studies on energy aspect of CLP can make it a favorable process in adoption of CO 2 capture in coal gasification processes leading to an emission-free power generation technology.

Current research efforts aimed at understanding the environmental implications of nanotechnology emphasize existing groups of nanoparticles and products already in commercial distribution. While this is clearly necessary, this approach fails to identify and address the many tradeoffs associated with product performance and environmental quality. We believe this to be a critical gap in the ongoing exploration of nanostructured materials and their properties and applications.

This type of cellulosic biomass is an attractive alternative to traditional monocultural biomass sources such as corn because it requires less purchased inputs in the agricultural phase and can be grown on marginal lands such as degraded farmland, but has lower yields of biomass per hectare and is more difficult to process during ethanol production. To analyze this tradeoff, an emergy analysis was performed to quantify the amount of direct and indirect energy needed to make ethanol from the growth of the biomass through the production of ethanol from the biomass. Emergy metrics calculated are environmental yield ratio, environmental loading ratio, sustainability index, and fraction renewable, all of which indicate that LIHD ethanol is more attractive emergetically than corn and switchgrass ethanol. However, ethanol produced in this manner represents a small fraction of the current gasoline consumption in the US, suggesting that conservation measures are important in addition to the production of biofuels to ensure energy security. Other benefits of a LIHD grassland such as increased resilience to pests and disease as well as the use of marginal land are not captured explicitly by emergy analysis and would likely further increase the attractiveness of ethanol produced from LIHD systems. © 2011 IEEE.","Energy conservation; ethanol; sustainable development; system analysis and design","Biomass source; Cellulosic biomass; Conservation measures; Emergy analysis; Energy security; Environmental Loading Ratio; Ethanol production; Lignocellulosic biomass; Sustainability index; Switchgrass; system analysis and design; Yield ratios; Biomass; Cellulosic ethanol; Farms; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Ethanol",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960735949

Applying thermodynamic thinking to problems of sustainable behavior is a significant advantage in bringing order to ill defined questions with a great variety of proposed solutions, some of which are more destructive than the original problem. The articles are pitched at a level accessible to advanced undergraduates and graduate students in courses on sustainability, sustainable engineering, industrial ecology, sustainable manufacturing, and green engineering. The timeliness of the topic, and the urgent need for solutions make this book attractive to general readers and specialist researchers as well.

These include traditional engineering approaches such as pinch [1, 2], exergy (see Chap. 2) and exergoeconomic analysis (see Chap. 15 by Tsatsaronis), that are used extensively for equipment and process design. Because environmentally conscious decisions require consideration of a broader boundary that accounts for the whole life cycle, many of these approaches have also been extended from the equipment to the life-cycle scale. Most methods that analyze the life cycle of industrial products focus on emissions and their impact and the use of nonrenewable resources such as fossil fuels and minerals. More recent efforts also account for the role of land, soil, etc. [3]. Although sophisticated methods have been developed and standardized for assessing the life-cycle impact of emissions [4, 5], methods for resource accounting have been lagging behind. Even with many resource aggregation methods developed over the past several decades, consensus about the most appropriate method is still nonexistent. In addition, most resource accounting methods fail to consider some of the most critical resources, namely, ecosystem goods and services, that sustain all life on Earth. This “natural capital” includes provisioning services such as minerals, fossil fuels, water, biomass; supporting services such as biogeochemical cycles, carbon sequestration, pollination; regulating services such as regulation of pests, climate, and soil fertility; and cultural services. © Cambridge University Press.",,"Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Ecology; Economics; Fossil fuels; Industrial emissions; Thermodynamics; Biogeochemical cycle; Carbon sequestration; Exergoeconomic analysis; Industrial processs; Non-renewable resource; Resource accountings; Resource aggregation; Traditional engineerings; Life cycle",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926123436

Exactly what a sustainable society is, is a highly debated topic, somewhat subject to personal value preferences. However, what is not sustainable is easier to identify. For example, in Jared Diamond's popular book, Collapse [1], he identified a variety of ancient and modern societies that failed. No one would dispute this claim. Although the reasons for these failures were complex, an important and common contributing factor was an inability to manage Earth's resources and thereby meet the needs of the society. For example, the inhabitants of Easter Island apparently became consumed with building giant stone statues (called moai), which required large timbers for their construction and for their transport from the quarry to the installation site. Apparently this building process, along with the destruction of the seeds wrought by the Polynesian rats, led to the destruction of most, if not all, of their trees. One result from this was a loss of the primary building material for their canoes. Because most fish were some distance from the shore, a lack of building materials for canoes meant fewer fish to eat and the inability to move to other islands. This desperate situation ultimately resulted in the islanders resorting to cannibalism. © Cambridge University Press.",,"Building materials; Fish; Building process; Contributing factor; Earth's resources; Easter island; Human use; Installation site; Sustainable society; Sustainable development",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926112553

Such methods, including life cycle assessment (LCA), net energy analysis, and exergetic LCA, rely on life-cycle inventory (LCI) data. These data are usually compiled from various sources, including industrial measurements, government databases, and fundamental knowledge, and include information about resource use and emissions. The reliability of the results of these assessment methods depends largely on the quality of the inventory data. Like all measured data, LCI data are also subject to various kinds of errors. The need for addressing uncertainty in LCA has been identified over the years by many researchers, and several papers have discussed their characteristics and sources. The types of uncertainties include those that are due to data inaccuracy, data gaps, model uncertainty, spatial and temporal variability, and mistakes [1–3]. Many methods have been explored for understanding the effect of such uncertainties, as summarized recently in [3, 4]. The nature and extent of uncertainties in LCA is such that formal methods for dealing with all of them are truly challenging to find. This chapter focuses on reducing data uncertainty in the LCI. Such uncertainty is due to process variability and failures such as instrument malfunction, poor sampling, or mistranscription of data.

The disciplines involved include mechanical and chemical engineering, physics, economics, geography, ecology, and industrial ecology. The contributors from Japan, Europe, and the United States are all to some extent speaking one language, albeit with different applications, construction of arguments, and degree of rigor. We believe that it is time for a book like this to introduce the fundamentals and applications of thermodynamics to demonstrate the richness and broad applicability of thermodynamic principles and the essential role that it can play in quantifying the impact of human activities on natural resources and the environment. Our goal has been to assemble a collection of chapters written by authorities in their own fields who share thermodynamics-inspired approaches to a diverse set of topics. Although there are many obstacles to presenting all of these different areas in a unified way, we believe we have succeeded in bringing together in one book a glimpse of the breadth of applications that can be considered from a thermodynamic perspective. Different chapters keep quite visible the flavor of a particular discipline, although some cross-fertilization and trans-disciplinary approaches to the issues are demonstrated. So, our ultimate goal has evolved into a promotion of the use of a rigorous science/engineering discipline (thermodynamics) not to solve problems beyond its realm but to assist in understanding the problem at hand, to define well the system considered, to implement conservation principles, and to appropriately merge such an approach with other disciplines. © Cambridge University Press.",,"Ecology; Sustainable development; Conservation Principles; Cross fertilization; Human activities; Industrial ecology; Sustainability issues; Trans-disciplinary approaches; Thermodynamics",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926093351

These resources include products such as air, water, minerals, and crude oil, and services such as carbon sequestration and pollution dissipation [1–4]. However, traditional methods in engineering and economics often fail to account for the contribution of ecosystems despite their obvious importance. The focus of these methods tends to be on short-term economic goals, whereas long-term sustainability issues get shortchanged. Such ignorance of ecosystems is widely believed to be one of the root causes behind a significant and alarming deterioration of global ecological resources [5–8]. Several methods have been developed to address the shortcomings of existing methods and to make them ecologically more conscious [9]. Among these, the preference-based methods use human valuation to account for ecosystem resources [3, 10, 11]. These methods use either a single monetary unit to readily compare economic and ecological contributions or multicriteria decision making to address trade-offs between indicators in completely different units. However, preference-based methods do not necessitate compliance with basic biophysical laws that all systems must satisfy and require knowledge about the role of ecological products and services that is often inadequate or unavailable. © Cambridge University Press.",,"Carbon; Decision making; Economics; Ecosystems; Resource valuation; Water pollution; Carbon sequestration; Ecological resources; Ecological systems; Long-term sustainability; Multi criteria decision making; Preference-based; Products and services; Support systems; Ecology",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895254005

For example, in the area of engineering, there have been claims of sustainable products, sustainable manufacturing, sustainable designs, and so forth. Although these uses may be well intended, they actually marginalize the term by implying that just getting better in some way is sustainable. Instead, sustainability needs to be connected to a worldview that encompasses how human society can maintain a good quality of life over a long time. Without this worldview framework, these claims of sustainable this and sustainable that ring hollow. In this context, we are inspired by the work of the authors (mostly economists with biological scientists) of the paper, Arrow et al. [1]. By starting with the well-known statement of sustainability from the UN Brundtland Report [2], they developed a measurable and workable (though controversial) criterion for sustainability. The Brundtland UN Commission statement on sustainability says, “sustainable development is the development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” This statement brings up many value-laden issues and at first blush seems unworkable. For example, what is a need for one person could be considered excessive consumption for another. Furthermore, who is to speak for future generations and to articulate their needs? In addition, what development means is of crucial importance, in particular, does development require growth, and if so, what kind. © Cambridge University Press.",,"Thermodynamics; Future generations; Human society; Quality of life; Sustainability science; Sustainable manufacturing; Sustainable products; UN Commission; Sustainable development",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895228998

Methods such as life cycle assessment, carbon and water footprinting are increasingly popular. In addition, many regions are developing byproduct synergy networks to enhance resource efficiency by using waste from one industry as a resource in another. Most efforts toward sustainability in engineering, including these, focus on enhancing efficiency of resource and energy use for a process or life cycle. Unfortunately, these efforts need not lead to sustainability. Additional efforts are required to address several challenges. These include accounting for the role of ecosystem services in life cycle analysis and decision making, considering the strong multidisciplinary, complex and wicked nature of the sustainability challenge.

Unutilized scrap tires can be a major source of pollution, and in the past decade Federal and state governments in the United States have encouraged the recycling and reuse of scrap tires in a number of applications, ranging from energy recovery to civil engineering materials to utilization of ground rubber in manufacturing. Life cycle inventory data are collected from primary industry sources as well as published literature, and life cycle impact analysis is performed using the TRACI tool. The results indicate that beneficial reuse of scrap tires, particularly in cement plants and artificial turf, provides reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air toxics, and water consumption. For example, every metric ton of tire-derived fuel substituted for coal in cement kilns avoids an estimated 543 kg (CO2 equivalent) of direct and indirect GHG emissions. Taking into account the deductible CO 2 from natural rubber, the avoided GHG emissions would be 613 CO 2 kg eq. per metric ton. The use of scrap tires for fuel in cement plants provides more reductions in most environmental impact categories compared to other scrap tire applications, excluding application in artificial turf. Although the use of ground rubber for artificial turf offers the greatest environmental emission reductions, it has limited potential for large-scale utilization due to the saturated market for artificial turf. Therefore, the use of fuel derived from scrap tires in cement production appears to be an attractive option in view of its large market capacity and significant potential for environmental impact reductions. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Alternative fuels; Cement production; Ground rubber; Life cycle assessment; Raw materials; Scrap tires; Tire-derived aggregates; Tire-derived fuels","Alternative fuels; Brickmaking; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cement plants; Cements; Commerce; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Raw materials; Rubber applications; Rubber industry; Scrap metal reprocessing; Tires; Water conservation; Cement production; Ground rubbers; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Scrap tires; Tire derived aggregates; Tire-derived fuel; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79451472167

The use of such a narrow boundary can lead to misleading results and perverse decisions. This paper introduces the idea of designing networks of technological systems along with their supporting ecological systems. Such networks of technological and ecological systems exploit the synergy between them and can help in closing material loops and minimize exergy loss, leading to truly self-sustaining systems. Methods for designing such technological-ecological synergy (TES) networks could be developed by extending existing process synthesis and design approaches to include ecological models. Such an approach would integrate industrial ecology with ecological engineering and require collaboration between engineers and ecologists. It presents many new challenges and opportunities for process systems engineering to contribute to the sustainability of engineered systems. The idea of TES networks is illustrated via several practical case studies, with focus on the life cycle of corn ethanol and a typical American residential system. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Design; Ecosystems; Life cycle; Networks; Sustainability","Biogeochemical cycle; Carbon sequestration; Corn-ethanol; Design approaches; Ecological engineering; Ecological models; Ecological systems; Engineered systems; Exergy loss; Existing method; Fossil resources; Human activities; Industrial ecology; Process synthesis; Process systems engineering; Soil formations; Sustainable engineering; Technological system; Biogeochemistry; Design; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Ethanol; Forestry; Mineral resources; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954533812

Proper understanding of the complex interrelations at multiple scales is critical for formulating effective policies and long term sustain ability. Existing methods for technology assessment and policy analysis tend to focus on a single scale. This work focuses on the need for the integrated multiscale modeling of industrial and economic systems. The broader goal is the development of a framework for the design of industrial processes and analyzing the effect of government policies. We are specifically using the economic input-output model for this work. This work will presents an approach for integrating the coarse scale EIO model with the fine scale engineering process models. The utility of the proposed framework is illustrated with the example of a cogeneration plant generating electricity and steam and operating under the disruptive scenario of the carbon tax. While the EIO model is used for estimating the price dimension, a fundamental physical model based on thermodynamic conservation laws and first principles is utilized for the cogeneration plant. The results and benefits of the proposed integrated multiscale optimization framework are compared with existing engineering optimization approaches that ignore price-demand interactions.","Cogeneration plant; Input-output model; Optimization","Biocomplexity; Carbon taxes; Conservation law; Economic system; Engineering optimization; Engineering process; Environmental systems; Existing method; First-principles; Government policy; Industrial processs; Industrial product; Input-output model; Long term; Multi-scale Modeling; Multi-scale optimization; Multiple scale; Physical model; Policy analysis; Sustainability assessment; Technology assessments; Temporal scale; Work Focus; Industry; Models; Optimization; Social aspects; Technological forecasting; Cogeneration plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955114590

Many components are readily scalable and size-independent; whereas, turbine blades have presented a new frontier in aerodynamic design. As the limits of glass fiber-reinforced plastics (GFRP) have been reached in this field, there is now a materials development problem in achieving outlooks for larger, more resilient WEC systems. A hybrid material is under development, which uses vapor-grown carbon nanofibers (VGCNF or CNF) to reinforce the interface of a glass fiber/epoxy matrix. This research aims to determine life cycle effects of substituting GFRP in large turbine blades with the hybrid material. A review of literature, databases, and industry reports on life cycle data for wind turbines helped to establish a baseline descriptive life cycle assessment (LCA). Trends of new installations were assessed to determine appropriate boundaries for comparison. Results indicate that cradle-to-gate processing energy of the new material is 1.4-7.7 times greater than for the original GFRP material on a MJ/kg basis under implicit assumptions of weight savings. Effects on energetic return on investment (EROI) vary from insignificant to substantial according to upstream process choices for CNF manufacture and solvent handling. All conclusions inherently assume that CNF -incorporation would lead to realizable technologies for substantially increasing either size or life span of turbine blades concomitant with weight savings. It is not yet substantiated whether replacement of long carbon fibers is advantageous both mechanically and energetically.","Carbon nanofibers (CNF); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Sustainability; Wind energy","Aerodynamic designs; Comparative life cycle assessment; Life span; Life-cycle assessments; Materials development; matrix; New material; Return on investments; Sustainability; Turbine blade; Upstream process; Vapor grown carbon nanofibers; Weight saving; Wind energy; Wind energy conversion; Wind power density; Wind turbine blades; Carbon fibers; Carbon nanofibers; Energy conversion; Fiber reinforced materials; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Glass fibers; Hybrid materials; Investments; Profitability; Sustainable development; Turbomachine blades; Wind power; Wind turbines; Life cycle; Carbon; Conversion; Energy; Fibers; Glass Fibers; Investment; Profitability; Reinforced Plastic; Turbines; Wind",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955103100

To overcome this challenge, emergy analysts approximate the emergy input from the economy via a single emergy/money ratio for the country and the monetary price of economic inputs. This amounts toassuming homogeneity in the entire economy, and can introduce serious uncertainties in the results. This paper proposes and demonstrates the use of a thermodynamically augmented economic input-output model of the US economy for obtaining sector-specific emergy to money ratios that can be used instead of a single ratio. These ratios at the economy scale are more accurate than a single economy-wide emergy/money ratio, and can be obtained quickly for hundreds of economic products and services. Comparing sector-specific emergy/money ratios with those from conventional emergy studies indicates that the input-output model can provide reasonable estimates of transformities at least as a stop-gap measure until more detailed analysis is completed. A hybrid approach to emergy analysis is introduced and compared with conventional emergy analysis using life cycles of corn ethanol and gasoline as examples. Emergy and transformity data from the hybrid approach are similar to those from conventional emergy analysis, indicating the usefulness of the proposed approach. In addition, this work proposes the metric of return on emergy investment for assessing product alternatives with the same utility such as transportation fuels. The proposed approach and data may be used easily via web-based software. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Corn ethanol; Economic input-output modeling; Emergy; Gasoline; Life cycle assessment; Return on investment","Economics; Ethanol; Gasoline; Life cycle; Corn-ethanol; Emergy; Input output model; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Re-turn-on; Economic analysis; accuracy assessment; economic analysis; emergy; estimation method; ethanol; homogeneity; hybrid; life cycle analysis; numerical model; software; thermodynamics; uncertainty analysis; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954364673

While it is possible to predict the simple broad-scale economic impacts of raising the price of carbon-intensive products-the demand for non-carbon-intensive products will increase-understanding the economic and environmental impacts of carbon policies throughout the life cycle of both types of products is more difficult. Using the example of a carbon tax, this study proposes a methodology that integrates short-term policy-induced consumer demand changes into the input-output framework to analyze the environmental and economic repercussions of a policy. Environmental repercussions include the direct and the indirect impacts on emissions, materials flow in the economy, and the reliance on various ecosystem goods and services. The approach combines economic data with data about physical flow of fossil fuels between sectors, consumption of natural resources and emissions from each sector. It applies several input-output modeling equations sequentially and uses various levels of aggregation/disaggregation. It is illustrated with the data for the 2002 U.S. economy and physical flows.

Being a simulation method, its performance relies to some extent on the generated samples or particles. For a poor initial guess a large fraction of particles is usually less representative of the underlying state's distribution and could even cause SMC to diverge. In this paper, an intuitive statistic, predictive density is proposed to monitor the particles' performance. When below a statistically controlled threshold value, our approach triggers smoothing for obtaining a better estimate of the initial state in the case of a poor prior. We find that combining a moving horizon smoother with SMC is very effective for recovering from a poor prior and develop an integrated practical approach that combines these two powerful tools. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Bayesian inference; Initial guess; Initial state; Moving horizon; Particle Filtering; Predictive density; Sequential Monte Carlo; Simulation methods; State-space models; Bayesian networks; Inference engines; Nonlinear filtering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953949753

For example, conventional Life Cycle Assessment focuses on the impact of emissions and consumption of some resources. While aggregation and interpretation methods are quite advanced for emissions, similar methods for resources have been lagging, and most ignore the role of nature. Such oversight may even result in perverse decisions that encourage reliance on deteriorating ecosystem services. This article presents a step toward including the direct and indirect role of ecosystems in LCA, and a hierarchical scheme to interpret their contribution. The resulting Ecologically Based LCA (Eco-LCA) includes a large number of provisioning, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services as inputs to a life cycle model at the process or economy scale. These resources are represented in diverse physical units and may be compared via their mass, fuel value, industrial cumulative exergy consumption, or ecological cumulative exergy consumption or by normalization with total consumption of each resource or their availability. Such results at a fine scale provide insight about relative resource use and the risk and vulnerability to the loss of specific resources. Aggregate indicators are also defined to obtain indices such as renew/ability, efficiency, and return on investment An Eco-LCA model of the 1997 economy is developed and made available via the web (www.resilience.osu.edu/ecolca). An illustrative example comparing paper and plastic cups provides insight into the features of the proposed approach.

This work provides insight into the nature of thermodynamic aggregation, including assumptions about substitutability between resources and loss of detailed information about the data being combined. Methods considered include calorific value or energy, industrial cumulative exergy consumption (ICEC) and its variations, and ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC) or emergy. A hierarchy of metrics is proposed that spans the range from detailed data to aggregate metrics. At the fine scale, detailed data can help identify resources to whose depletion the selected product is most vulnerable. At the coarse scale, new insight is provided about thermodynamic aggregation methods. Among these, energy analysis is appropriate only for products that rely primarily on fossil fuels, and it cannot provide a useful indication of renewability. Exergy-based methods can provide results similar to energy analysis by including only nonrenewable fuels but can also account for materials use and provide a renewability index. However, ICEC and its variations do not address substitutability between resources, causing its results to be dominated by dilute and low-quality resources such as sunlight. The use of monetary values to account for substitutability does not consider many ecological resources and may not be appropriate for the analysis of emerging products. ECEC or emergy explicitly considers substitutability and resource quality and provides more intuitive results but is plagued by data gaps and uncertainties. This insight is illustrated via application to the life cycles of gasoline, diesel, corn ethanol, and soybean biodiesel. Here, aggregate metrics reveal the dilemma facing the choice of fuels: high return on investment versus high renewability. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Aggregation methods; Corn-ethanol; Cumulative exergy consumption; Data gap; Emerging products; Emergy analysis; Energy analysis; Life cycle analysis; Life-cycle assessments; Low qualities; Monetary value; Non-renewable fuels; Return on investments; Transportation fuels; Economics; Energy management; Ethanol; Exergy; Fossil fuels; Profitability; Thermodynamics; Investments; alcohol; biodiesel; diesel fuel; fuel; gasoline; biofuel; emergy; exergy; life cycle; natural resource; thermodynamics; article; chemical analysis; energy; life cycle assessment; renewable energy; thermodynamics; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Models, Chemical; Thermodynamics; Time Factors; Vehicle Emissions; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74949117945

Proper understanding of such disruptive scenarios and their impact using holistic and integrated systems modeling techniques is crucial for effective resource allocation and disaster management. An Input-Output (IO) based framework is presented for studying the effect of sudden shocks and quantifying the associated risks on complex industrial networks. We are specifically using the IO model to understand the impact of changes in the availability of natural resources including natural capital on industrial systems. This includes understanding the potential impact of loss of services such as pollination, water scarcities, and soil fertility. The utility of the framework is highlighted using two case studies involving loss of pollination services provided by managed honeybees and reduction in the availability of crude oil. The approach is suitable for modeling the effect of sudden perturbations such as resource shortage on the complex industrial systems and identifying industrial sectors with greatest sensitivity to a given perturbation. This work is expected to complement the traditional biophysical models and methods by including the behavior of complex industrial networks under sudden shocks, quantifying the associated risks and support a decision-making framework for risk management.","Industrial sectors; Inoperability; Input-output model; Natural capital","Biophysical model; Complex industrial systems; Disaster management; Industrial networks; Industrial sector; Industrial systems; Infrastructure systems; Inoperability input-output model; Input-output; Integrated systems; Natural capital; Natural disasters; Potential impacts; Resource shortage; Soil fertility; Terrorist attacks; Water scarcity; Crude oil; Decision making; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Risk management; Technology; Industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950999686

However, the resulting designs are often directly or indirectly dependent on ecosystem goods and services and this is often ignored. Neglecting these invaluable services has led to unsustainable practices through overexploitation of ecosystems. In addition, narrowly focusing on technological solutions unnecessarily prevents engineers from turning to nature as an option in process design. This paper proposes integrating technological systems and their corresponding ecological systems in process design. These technological-ecological networks (TEco-Nets) mimic the way nature operates by having closed material and energy streams, or in other words, ""waste = food"". Such networks would be a step towards true sustainability. However, ecological and technological systems are usually outside the area of expertise of engineers and ecologists, respectively. Therefore, integrating the two disciplines would be challenging yet potentially fruitful. In this study, the concept of TEco-Nets is illustrated through a qualitative example of a sugarcane refinery as well as quantitative case study of a residential system. The residential system example indicates that the carbon carrying capacity of the associated ecosystems is overwhelmed under traditional operating conditions. However, modifying the design of the technological and ecological systems helps alleviate this and indicates that residential systems could operate closer to sustainability in terms of carbon. This example suggests that TEco-Nets may be beneficial in larger scale industrial process design problems.","Ecosystems; Green buildings; Process design; Sustainability","Carrying capacity; Ecological networks; Ecological systems; Energy streams; Green buildings; In-process; Industrial process design; Operating condition; Overexploitation; Practical problems; Sustainable process; Technological solution; Technological system; Waste food; Design; Ecosystems; Energy conversion; Sustainable development; Technology; Process design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950998329

Because this likelihood information is often unavailable for many practical problems, approaches based on repeated measurements or process constraints have been developed for their estimation. Such approaches are limited by data availability and often lack theoretical rigor. In this article, a novel Bayesian approach is proposed to tackle this problem. Uncertainty about the error variances is incorporated in the Bayesian framework by setting noninformative priors for the noise variances. This general strategy is used to modify the Sampling-based Bayesian Latent Variable Regression (Chen et al., J Chemom., 2007) approach, to make it more robust to inaccurate information about the likelihood functions. Different noninformative priors for the noise variables are discussed and unified in this work.

The latter natural capital is essential for sustainability but is only considered partially in conventional LCA. Accounting for ecological resources introduces the challenge of how to aggregate resources of widely varying qualities such as sunlight, wood, water, and coal. Methods based on mass, energy, and energy have been proposed and are evaluated in this work. In addition, this work aims to analyze three LCA techniques with different system boundaries: conventional process-based LCA, hybrid economic input-output LCA (EIO-LCA), and hybrid ecologically based LCA (Eco-LCA). These three methods are applied to the case study of 1, 3-propanediol (PDO) produced via fossil-based and bio-based feedstocks. The results of this study indicate that a hierarchical set of metrics can be useful for gaining insight into the role of ecosystem resources in a life cycle. Among aggregation methods, ecological cumulative exergy consumption seems to provide meaningful results, but more empirical studies are needed. It is also determined that bio-based PDO is more attractive than fossil-based PDO because of less nonrenewable resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, bio-based PDO does rely more on land, water, and fertile soil. By determining the impact of making the current PDO demand entirely from corn, it is found that the consumption of natural resources relative to national consumption is very low. While producing PDO alone from corn may have a negligible impact in terms of emissions and resource use, switching other products to bio-based will have an additive effect, increasing the strain on some ecological goods and services. These impacts should be addressed before promoting the large scale production of bio-based products. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"1 ,3 propanediol; Additive effects; Aggregate resources; Aggregation methods; Bio-based feedstock; Bio-based products; Cumulative exergy consumption; Empirical studies; Fertile soils; Gaining insights; Input-output; Large scale productions; Life cycle evaluations; Life-cycle assessments; National consumption; Natural capital; Non-renewable resource; Propanediols; Resource use; System boundary; Technological alternatives; Uncertain datas; Biomass; Ecology; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Coal deposits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949140781

While toxicity studies of engineered nanomaterials are essential, understanding of the potential large scale impacts of nanotechnology is also critical for developing sustainable nanoproducts. This work evaluates the life cycle energetic impact associated with the production and use of carbon nanofiber (CNF) reinforced polymer nanocomposites (PNC). Specifically, both simple CNF and carbon nanofiber-glass fiber (CNF-GF) hybrid PNCs are evaluated and compared with steel for equal stiffness design. Life cycle inventory is developed based on published literature and best available engineering information. A cradle-to-gate comparison suggests that for equal stiffness design, CNF reinforced PNCs are 1.6-12 times more energy intensive than steel. It is anticipated that the product use phase may strongly influence whether any net savings in life cycle energy consumption can be realized. A case study involving the use of CNF and CNF-GF reinforced PNCs in the body panels of automobiles highlights that the use of PNCs with lower CNF loading ratios has the potential for net life cycle energy savings relative to steel owing to improved fuel economy benefits.

The motivators for such change include an increasingly tightening regulatory regime, increased consumer awareness, and inclination of investors to consider risks associated with lendings to hazardous material industries. As an effort to become ""greener"", chemical industries are making conscious efforts to reduce their resource intensities or footprints. Such efforts need to be supported by models that can quantify the broad economic and environmental implications of industrial decisions. This manuscript uses the recently developed Ecologically Based Life Cycle Assessment (EcoLCA) model of the United States economy to analyze resource intensities of chemical industry sectors, comparing them with each other and with other industry sectors. The raw numbers are normalized by national flows to gain insight into possible resource vulnerabilities of industrial sectors. These numbers are also aggregated based on their mass or exergy to reduce their dimensionality and permit easier interpretation. Ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC) allows consideration of a wide variety of ecosystem goods and services, human resources and emissions and their impacts on a consistent basis, and is shown to provide unique insight in addition to conventional measures based on mass and Industrial cumulative exergy consumption (ICEC). Ratios of ECEC to money indicate the relative throughputs of natural to economic capital, and are used for investigating supply chains of selected sectors and identifying likely keystone sectors. The insights obtained by juxtaposing resource intensities of chemical industry sectors amongst themselves and with those of the rest of economy are used to identify opportunities for reducing resources intensities of chemical industry sectors that could enable improvement of their environmental sustainability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed approach explores the improved ability of wavelet packets in extracting features with arbitrary locations, and having different localizations in the time-frequency domain, in order to improve the detection performances achieved with wavelet-based MSSPC. A novel approach is also developed for adoptively selecting the best decomposition depth. Such an approach is described in detail and tested using artificial simulated signals, employed to compare average run length (ARL) performance against other SPC methodologies. Furthermore, its performance under real world situations is also assessed, for two industrial case studies using dataseis containing process upsets, through the construction of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Both univariate and multivariate cases are covered. ARL results for a step perturbation show that the proposed methodology presents a steady good performance for all shift magnitudes, without significantly changing its relative scores, as happens with other current methods, whose relative performance depends on the shift magnitude being tested. For artificial disturbances, with features localized in the time/frequency domain, multiscale methods do present the best performance, and for the particular case of detecting a decrease in autocorrelation they are the only ones that can detect such a perturbation. In the examples using industrial dataseis, where disturbances exhibit more complex patterns, multiscale approaches also present the best results, in particular in the range of low false alarms, where monitoring methods are aimed to operate. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Multiscale statistical process control; Statistical process control; Wavelet-packets; Wavelets","Average Run Length; Basis functions; Complex patterning; Detection performances; Extracting features; False alarms; Industrial case studies; Monitoring methods; Multi scaling; Multi-scale approaches; Multi-scale methods; Multiscale statistical process control; Real-world situations; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Relative performance; Simulated signals; Time-frequency domains; Univariate; Wavelet-packets; Wavelets; Alarm systems; Chlorine compounds; Control theory; Feature extraction; Ketones; Perturbation techniques; Process control; Production control; Quality control; Statistical methods; Surface treatment; Statistical process control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52649146451

This article presents one of the first assessments of the life cycle energy requirements and environmental impact of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) synthesis. Life cycle inventory data are compiled with data reported in the open literature. The results of the study indicate relatively higher life cycle energy requirements and higher environmental impact of CNFs as compared to traditional materials, like primary aluminum, steel, and polypropylene, on an equal mass basis. Life cycle energy requirements for CNFs from a range of feedstock materials are found to be 13 to 50 times that of primary aluminum on an equal mass basis. Similar trends are observed from the results of process life cycle assessment (LCA), as conveyed by different midpoint and endpoint damage indicators. Savings in life cycle energy consumption and, hence, reductions in environmental burden are envisaged if higher process yields of these fibers can be achieved in continuous operations. Since the comparison of CNFs is performed on an equal mass basis with traditional materials, these results cannot be generalized for CNF-based nanoproducts. Quantity of use of these engineered nanomaterials and resulting benefits will decide their energy and environmental impact. Nevertheless, the life cycle inventory and the results of the study can be used for evaluating the environmental performance of specific CNF-based nanoproducts. © 2008 by Yale University.","Damage indicators; Energy analysis; Industrial ecology; Nanomaterials; Nanotechnology; Process life cycle assessment (LCA)","Alumina; Carbon nanofibers; Damage detection; Energy management; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Intelligent materials; Nanofibers; Nanostructured materials; Nanotechnology; Systems analysis; Continuous operations; Damage indicators; Emerging technologies; Energy analysis; Energy consumptions; Energy requirements; Engineered nanomaterials; Environmental burdens; Environmental performances; Evaluating; Feedstock materials; Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessments; Life cycle inventories; Nanomaterials; Nanoproducts; Potential benefits; Primary aluminums; Process yields; Traditional materials; Life cycle; comparative study; environmental impact assessment; industrial performance; life cycle analysis; manufacturing; nanotechnology; technological development; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54349118186

Their development takes advantage of considering the basic laws of economics and thermodynamics. With respect to the latter, the exergy concept pops up. Although its fundamentals, that is, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, were already established in the 1800s, it is only in the last years that the exergy concept has gained a more widespread interest in process analysis, typically employed to identify inefficiencies. However, exergy analysis today is implemented far beyond technical analysis; it is also employed in environmental, (thermo)economic, and even sustainability analysis of industrial systems. Because natural ecosystems are also subjected to the basic laws of thermodynamics, it is another subject of exergy analysis. After an introduction on the concept itself, this review focuses on the potential and limitations of the exergy concept in (1)ecosystem analysis, utilized to describe maximum storage and maximum dissipation of energy flows (2); industrial system analysis: from single process analysis to complete process chain analysis (3); (thermo)economic analysis, with extended exergy accounting; and (4) environmental impact assessment throughout the whole life cycle with quantification of the resource intake and emission effects. Apart from technical system analysis, it proves that exergy as a tool in environmental impact analysis may be the most mature field of application, particularly with respect to resource and efficiency accounting, one of the major challenges in the development of sustainable technology. Far less mature is the exergy analysis of natural ecosystems and the coupling with economic analysis, where a lively debate is presently going on about the actual merits of an exergy-based approach. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Constraint theory; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Sustainable development; Energy flows; Sustainability analysis; Exergy; Constraint theory; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Exergy; Sustainable development; economic analysis; ecosystem approach; energy dissipation; energy flow; environmental impact assessment; environmental technology; exergy; life cycle analysis; literature review; sustainability; systems analysis; technological development; thermodynamics; economics; ecosystem; energy; energy balance; environment; environmental impact; industry; life cycle; review; technology; thermodynamics; Ecology; Thermodynamics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649115488

However, the environmental impacts of the life cycle phases and comparison with alternative methods have not been studied. Such a life cycle assessment (LCA) is essential before any legitimate claims of ""greenness"" can be made and is the subject of this paper. The model IL selected is 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim][BF 4]) and its use as a solvent for the manufacture of cyclohexane and in a Diels-Alder reaction was assessed. These uses are compared with more conventional synthesis methods. The results indicate that processes that use IL are highly likely to have a larger life cycle environmental impact than more conventional methods. Sensitivity analysis shows that the result is robust to errors and variation in the data. For cyclohexane synthesis, the industrial gas phase process is the greenest but the three solvents compared for the Diels-Alder reaction showed comparable life cycle impact. Although ILs are not the most attractive alternatives, the result may change if their separation efficiency, stability and recyclability are improved. Because there are many kinds of ILs, with many applications, two examples are not enough to reach any general conclusions about the greenness of all ILs. However, the life cycle data and approach of this study can be used for evaluating the greenness of more kinds of solvents, processes, and emerging technologies. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Life cycle; Molecular structure; Separation; Solvents; Diels-Alder reaction; Life cycle assessment; Separation efficiency; Ionic liquids; 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate; cyclohexane; ionic liquid; solvent; Ionic liquids; Life cycle; Molecular structure; Separation; Solvents; comparative study; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; organic compound; recycling; sensitivity analysis; solvent; article; Diels Alder reaction; environmental impact assessment; life cycle assessment; sensitivity analysis; Ions; Solvents; Alnus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40949090119

Traditional LCA mainly focuses on emissions and their impact throughout the life cycle. Consumption of some nonrenewable resources and land use are also sometimes included in the results, albeit in a variety of units. End-point impact assessment methods combine these results, but are often controversial due to their reliance on subjective valuation. Other life cycle approaches include energy analysis, which only accounts for nonrenewable energy use and has been popular for the analysis of energy processes and transportation fuels. Most existing methods ignore the role of ecosystem goods and services, which are the very resources that are crucial for sustainability. Another shortcoming of conventional LCA is that the necessary inventory data about emissions and impact are often not available for emerging technologies and at early stages of decision making. This presentation describes a fundamentally different approach to LCA that accounts for the contribution of ecosystem goods and services to industrial activity (natural capital). This Ecologically-Based LCA or EcoLCA accounts for inputs from nature such as water use from different sources, soil erosion, land use, wind, sunlight and bio-geo-chemical cycles. Other resources such as minerals and fossil fuels are also included. Such information is available in diverse units of mass, quantity or energy, which are difficult to combine and highly multivariate. Methods are proposed for characterizing and categorizing this information in a few categories such as ecosystem goods, ecosystem services, renewable, nonrenewable etc. These mid-point categories may be further combined to yield end-point indicators. Various physical methods such as mass, energy, cumulative exergy and emergy are explored for the proposed categorization. If data for a conventional LCA is available, it can also be combined with the proposed approach.",,"Chemical cycles; Early stages; Ecosystem services; Emerging technologies; Energy analysis; Energy processes; Existing methods; If datums; Impact assessments; Industrial activities; Inventory datums; Life cycle approaches; Life Cycle assessments; Nonrenewable energies; Nonrenewable resources; Physical methods; Products and services; Short-comings; Soil erosions; Transportation fuels; Water uses; Ecology; Ecosystems; Energy management; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Erosion; Fossil fuels; Land use; Minerals; Point contacts; Problem solving; Soil mechanics; Water supply; Wind power; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053656014

Such information includes prior knowledge about the underlying variables, model parameters and measurement error distributions. This paper improves upon the existing optimization-based BLVR (BLVR-OPT) method [1] by developing a sampling-based Bayesian latent variable regression (BLVR-S) method that relies on Gibbs sampling. Use of the sampling-based framework not only provides point estimates, but its ability to generate samples that represent the posterior distribution of the unknown variables, also readily provides error bounds. Features and advantages of this method are demonstrated via examples based on simulated data and real Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data. Practical aspects of Bayesian modeling such as determining when the extra computation may be worth the effort are addressed by an empirical study of the effects of the amount of training data and signal to noise ratio (SNR). The benefits of BLVR seem to be most significant when the number of measurements is limited and when noise in output variables is relatively large.

Bayesian statistics can further enhance the ability to use domain specific information to obtain more accurate and useful models, and presents many research opportunities as well as challenges. Although Bayesian statistics is not new, recent advances via sampling-based Monte Carlo methods make these methods practical for large scale applications without making the common assumptions of Gaussian noise and uniform prior distributions, made by most chemometric methods. This article provides an overview of traditional chemometric methods from a Bayesian view and a tutorial of some recently developed techniques in Bayesian chemometrics, such as Bayesian PCA and Bayesian latent variable regression. New challenges and opportunities for future work are also identified. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is often difficult to apply, especially to emerging technologies due to the difficulty of finding accurate output-side emissions and impact data. Usually, input-side data are more readily available, even for emerging technologies, and may provide a reasonable proxy for predicting the environmental impact associated with emissions. In this paper, this relationship is explored by case studies and regression of life cycle impact with input-side quantities of cumulative mass, energy, and exergy. As a single quantity, this study indicates that ecological cumulative exergy consumption may be best at predicting environmental impact. This work also confirmss that if the input variables are separated, then nonrenewable energy use dominates overall impact. However, nonrenewable minerals and some renewable resources are also highly correlated with impact, and nonrenewable energy is only good at prediction of impact due to emission of CO2, SO 2, and NO2. These preliminary results suggest the promise of using input-side metrics to predict life cycle environmental impact, and identifies areas of future work.",,"Carbon dioxide; Exergy; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Minerals; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Cumulative mass; Impact data; Output-side emissions; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548803803

The real data must satisfy the laws of thermodynamics, so the quality of LCI data may be enhanced by adjusting them to satisfy these laws. This is not a new idea, but a formal thermodynamically sound and statistically rigorous approach for accomplishing this task is not yet available. This article proposes such an approach based on methods for data rectification developed in process systems engineering. This approach exploits redundancy in the available data and models and solves a constrained optimization problem to remove random errors and estimate some missing values. The quality of the results and presence of gross errors are determined by statistical tests on the constraints and measurements. The accuracy of the rectified data is strongly dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the available models, which should capture information such as the life-cycle network, stream compositions, and reactions. Such models are often not provided in LCI databases, so the proposed approach tackles many new challenges that are not encountered in process data rectification. An iterative approach is developed that relies on increasingly detailed information about the life-cycle processes from the user.

Methods for solving such problems either ignore the constraints or rely on crude approximations of the model or probability distributions. Such approximations may reduce the accuracy of the estimates since they often fail to capture the variety of probability distributions encountered in constrained linear and nonlinear dynamic systems. This article describes a practical approach that overcomes these shortcomings via a novel extension of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling or particle filtering. Inequality constraints are imposed by accept/reject steps in the algorithm. The proposed approach provides samples representing the posterior distribution at each time point, and is shown to satisfy the same theoretical properties as unconstrained SMC.

However, many LCI data, be they from commercial software or public domain databases, violate the laws of thermodynamics due to errors, missing data, and other inconsistencies. The process engineering method of data rectification is appealing for improving the quality of LCI data, but applying this approach poses many new challenges that are not addressed in traditional rectification. One such challenge is due to the availability of life cycle data at multiple overlapping scales. This includes engineering data at the equipment and process scales, process LCA data at the value chain scale, and economic input-output and toxic release inventory data at the economy scale. This article develops a method for rectification of such multiscale data. Rectification is accomplished via a mixed integer optimization-based approach, and it is integrated with the existing computational methods for different types of traditional and hybrid LCA. The developed method may also be used for multiscale data from process engineering. It is applied to data for a caustic soda process from a public domain LCI database to illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach and identify further challenges. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Data rectification; Life cycle assessment; Multiscale rectification; Sustainable engineering","Data rectification; Life cycle assessment; Multiscale rectification; Sustainable engineering; Computer software; Data reduction; Database systems; Life cycle; Optimization; Reliability theory; Inventory control; Computer software; Data reduction; Database systems; Inventory control; Life cycle; Optimization; Reliability theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047197323

Industrial cumulative exergy consumption (ICEC) captures the exergy of all natural resources consumed directly and indirectly by each economic sector, while ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC) also accounts for the exergy consumed in ecological systems for producing each natural resource. Information about exergy consumed in nature is obtained from the thermodynamics of biogeochemical cycles. As used in this work, ECEC is analogous to the concept of emergy, but does not rely on any of its controversial claims. The TIO model can also account for emissions from each sector and their impact and the role of labor. The use of consistent exergetic units permits the combination of various streams to define aggregate metrics that may provide insight into aspects related to the impact of economic sectors on the environment. Accounting for the contribution of natural capital by ECEC has been claimed to permit better representation of the quality of ecosystem goods and services than ICEC. The results of this work are expected to permit evaluation of these claims.

LCA is mainly an ""output side"" method due to its focus on emissions and their impact, but such data are often difficult to find, particularly for emerging technologies. Furthermore, although an important goal of LCA is to evaluate the environmental sustainability of technological alternatives, the very ecosystem goods and services that sustain all economic activities are usually ignored. This paper describes how thermodynamics can complement and enhance LCA by addressing these challenges. Ecosystem goods and services may be represented as the cumulative exergy consumed in ecological processes necessary for producing them. This may be calculated via methods in systems ecology and combined with engineering thermodynamics for joint analysis of industrial and ecological systems. A Thermodynamic Input-Output model of the US economy is developed based on this approach, and is used for hybrid LCA. Accounting for ecosystem goods and services is likely to provide a reasonable proxy to life cycle impact even without knowing details about emissions and their impact. This is because as per the second law, exergy is not conserved, but is lost in each transformation step. The exergy lost to the surroundings creates disorder in the environment, which should be related to the impact of emissions. This implies that among alternatives with similar utility, the process with a higher life cycle thermodynamic efficiency should have a smaller life cycle environmental impact. This talk will present some examples as preliminary support of this hypothesis and describe challenges and on-going work for obtaining a more rigorous statistical validation. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Ecology; Electronic equipment manufacture; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Statistical methods; Sustainable development; Cumulative exergy; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Thermodynamic efficiency; Thermodynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845576244

However, most contemporary accounting techniques, including engineering economics, life cycle assessment, and full cost accounting, fail in this regard, as they take natural capital for granted and concentrate mainly on the economic aspects and emissions. The recently developed ""thermodynamic input-output analysis"" (TIOA) includes the contribution of ecological goods, ecosystem services, human resources, and impact of emissions in an economic input-output model. This paper uses TIOA to determine the throughputs of natural and economic capitals along industrial supply networks. The ratios of natural to economic capitals of economic sectors reveals a hierarchical organization of the U.S. economy wherein basic infrastructure industries are at the bottom and specialized value-added industries constitute the top. These results provide novel insight into the reliance of specific industrial sectors and supply chains on natural capital and the corresponding economic throughput. Such insight is useful for understanding the implications of corporate restructuring on industrial sustainability metrics and of outsourcing of business activities on outsourcer, outsourcee, and global sustainability. These implications are discussed from the standpoints of weak and strong sustainability paradigms. The calculated ratios can also be used for hybrid thermodynamic life cycle assessment. © 2005 American Chemical Society.",,"Cost accounting; Ecosystems; Life cycle; Personnel; Sustainable development; Thermodynamics; Economic capital; Engineering economics; Thermodynamic input-output analysis; Value-added industries; Industrial economics; sustainability; accounting; article; economic aspect; engineering; financial management; industry; life cycle; sustainable development; thermodynamics; United States; Costs and Cost Analysis; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Industry; Models, Economic; Program Evaluation; Thermodynamics; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29244482792

However, techniques for evaluating natural capital flows are not yet satisfactorily developed. Traditional methods in engineering, economics and other disciplines tend to focus on economic capital while ignoring the contribution of ecological resources. In this dissertation a new thermodynamic approach is proposed that addresses this shortcoming. The new approach, called Thermodynamic Input-Output Analysis (TIOA), calculates degradation of energy quality in the economic and ecological stages of the production chain of a process or product. In this analysis energy quality is measured in terms of exergy or available energy. TIOA synthesizes data about natural and human resource consumption and emissions from various public domain databases. It uses concepts from systems ecology to determine exergy flows in the ecological stages and economic input-output analysis to determine exergy flows in the economic stages of a production chain. This dissertation applies TIOA to analyze the 91-sector 1992 and the 488-sector 1997 representations of the US economy. It calculates natural capital throughputs of individual industry sectors in terms of their Ecological Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ECEC). It also juxtaposes natural capital throughputs with economic capital throughputs by calculating ECEC/money ratios. These ratios indicate the discrepancy between thermodynamic work and the willingness of people to pay for economic goods and services. ECEC/money ratios are found to decrease from basic infrastructure industries to value-added service industries suggesting that the service industries are better at valuing ecosystem contribution than the resource extraction and manufacturing industries. These results are shown to have important implications to construction of pro-ecological macroeconomic policies. TIOA also calculates ECEC/ICEC ratios to determine the degree to which conventional thermodynamic techniques underestimate the contribution of ecosystems. The industry-specific ECEC/money and ICEC/money ratios are a major improvement over single economy-wide emergy/$ ratios in emergy analysis and similar aggregate metrics in thermoeconomics. Such industry specific ratios are useful in hybrid thermodynamic analysis of industrial systems and provide a unique insight into their environmental implications. This has been illustrated by comparing alternative electricity generation systems. Industry specific ECEC/money and ICEC/money ratios are also useful in constructing the hierarchical thermodynamic metrics of sustainability. Such metrics have many desirable attributes of ideal sustainability metrics such as stackability, robustness, non-perverseness in indicating progress towards sustainability and communicable to diverse audiences and stake-holders. In the end, this dissertation proposes a multiscale statistical framework for Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis. Such framework treats LCI as a statistical data fusion problem and ensures maximum utilization available data and models.

Much of the research in green chemistry focuses on replacing toxic and hazardous substances such as solvents, catalysts and reaction media by alternatives that are non-toxic or reduce emissions. Unfortunately, most new developments in green chemistry are not evaluated for their ""greenness"" via a systematic analysis of their environmental impact during their life cycle. Consequently, it is likely that many techniques that are claimed to be green may not really have a smaller environmental impact over their life cycle. Although LCA is a well developed approach, it is still best suited for evaluating mature technologies for which life cycle inventory data are available. Such data are very difficult to find for emerging technologies. This paper presents one of the first LCAs to compare green versus traditional chemistries. A traditional LCA is performed with data reported by chemists. This approach is not convenient because information about emissions and impact is rarely available from the laboratory scale processes. A novel thermodynamic approach that does not rely on information about emissions and their impact is also used. This approach relies on input-side information, which is usually more readily available, and seems to be well correlated with emissions and their impact. This paper takes Ionic Liquids (IL's) as examples, two kinds of promising applications of ionic liquid are analyzed to compare it with traditional methods or traditional solvents. Ionic liquids are organic salts whose melting point is normally below about 100°C. Recent research about IL's and their applications is booming, partly because they are considered to be 'green solvents'. This impression of environmental friendliness is due to their extremely low vapor pressure, which makes them good substitutes to traditional industrial solvents, most of which are Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Replacement would prevent the emission of VOCs, a major source of environmental pollution. One of applications of Ionic Liquids is to be used as solvents in hydrogenation reaction. Although Ionic liquids seem like a promising solution in organic chemistry, there are still several issues that need to be explored for confirming their ""greenness"". It is critical to collect environmental, health data before encouraging the use of IL's as alternatives for organic solvents, as well as perform their Life Cycle Assessment to study the environmental impacts throughout a product's broader life cycle to ensure that the environmental impact is not just being shifted to other stages of the life cycle. The two examples of IL's applications are hydrogenation of benzene to form cyclohexane and Diels-Alder Reaction. 1-methyl-3-butyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim][BF4]) is selected as a typical Ionic Liquid. Hydrogenation is an important catalytic method in synthetic organic chemistry both on the laboratory and the production scale. The classical hydrogenation catalysts are heterogeneous catalysts. However, homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts in liquid phase have attracted considerable interest recently, and Ionic Liquids are good alternative reaction mediums. The methods evaluated include the traditional industrial process, and newer green chemistries based on ionic liquids and water solvents. Besides the advantage that Ionic Liquids have no (or negligible) vapor pressure, they have some other benign properties: Ionic liquids provide a polar, non-nucleophilic environment which can stabilize the homogeneous hydrogenation catalyst and increase catalyst lifetime; comparing with water, which is also considered as one of ""Green Solvents"", Ionic liquids can dissolve more hydrogen, which leads to a higher reaction rate. Diels-Alder reaction is also an important and widely used reaction in organic synthesis, and in the chemical industry. The rate enhancement of this reaction can be achieved by using ionic liquids, water, and 5M lithium perchlorate-diethyl ether mixtures (5M LPDE). In this paper, the reaction of cyclopentadiene and ethyl acrylate is selected as an example to compare the efficiency of [Bmim][BF 4], water and LPDE. The reaction produce two kinds of molecules: endo and exo, and we take endo molecule as product. A ""cradle to gate"" Life Cycle Assessment is performed to compare alternatives in each example. LCA inventories are from public database. The inventory data are converted to environmental impact by the method of Eco-Indicator 99. Three overall comparison results are shown in the following tables. Table Presented Table 1 is comparison of solvents, including [Bmim][BF4], water and some organic solvents. It shows that water is always the best, the Diels-Alder reaction candidate 5M LPDE is better than [Bmim][BF4], but [Bmim][BF4] is not worse than the other three organic solvents. Table 2 Presented Table 2 shows the results of cyclohexane production. [Bmim][BF4] scenario is the worst scenario, water is the second, and industrial scenario is the best. We can conclude no solvents are usually better than solvents. Although water is very environmental benign, and homogeneous catalyst system may achieve higher yield and higher efficiency, solvent systems need separation after the reaction phase, and separation needs organic solvent to extract, which makes the solvent system impracticable. Table 3 shows the results of Diels-Alder reaction. The results are close for the three solvents because all the reaction conditions are the same for the three solvents, but it still tells us the 5M LPDE is the best, then is [Bmim][BF4], and the worst is water. It is interesting to compare the results of water and [Bmim][BF4] in the two examples. For cyclohexane, [Bmim][BF4] case is worse than water, however, for Diels-Alder reaction, [Bmim][BF4] case is better than water. This is because two different issues dominate the results in these two examples. Ionic Liquids are complicated compounds, and a long life chain is required to synthesis them, so large amount of pollutions are produced during this process. It makes IL's are much worse than water, which is shown in the table 1. Since the solvents issue dominate the environmental impacts, cyclohexane production in [Bmim][BF4] is worse than water. However, yields dominate the results of Diels-Alder reaction, the sequence of yields from high to low is 5M LPDE, [Bmim][BF4] and water. The more material loss results in more environmental impacts. It worth to be notified that yield of cyclohexane in [Bmim][BF4] is also higher than in water, but it is not so significant. Table Presented Thermodynamic Life Cycle Assessment is also applied to the cyclohexane production example. The method is similar to Life Cycle Assessment, but it calculates total input exergy (useful energy) instead of pollutions and environmental impacts. Two values are calculated to compare different cyclohexane production methods, one is Industrial Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ICEC), and the other is Ecological Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ECEC). ICEC only considers the exergy in industrial scale, but ECEC also includes ecological products and ecological services, for example, rain and wind. ECEC is constituted of four parts: Nonrenewable energy (NR), Renewable energy (REN), Impact of pollution (IP), and Human resources (HR). Data is given in Table 4. Table Presented In this analysis, [Bmim][BF4] is still the worst scenario, then the water scenario, and the industrial process is the best, except that water scenario consumes more renewable energy than [Bmim][BF4] scenario. This is consistent with environmental LCA, which means if a process consumes more exergy, it may have more environmental impacts. So when information about emission and impact is hard to get, we can try to roughly estimate them by considering how much exergy is consumed in the input side. From these comparisons, it seems IL's are not bad solvents, especially compared with other organic solvents. Although it needs a long life chain to synthesize, it has lower vapor pressure. So in the situation solvents are essential, and IL give a higher efficiency than organics, choosing IL may reduce the VOC emissions. But this is only valid if it is easy to separate IL from product. Diels-Alder reaction is such a case; on the contrary, cyclohexane production is not. Industrial cyclohexane process is mature, and it needs not solvents, furthermore the separation is quite easy due to the very high yield. So using IL, or even water, can only cause more trouble, especially in the separation phase. In a word, manufacture of cyclohexane via ""green"" solvents may not be environmentally preferable. Chemistries where IL's may outperform traditional processes from a life cycle point of view will be further discussed.",,"Benzene; Catalysts; Environmental impact; Hazardous materials; Hydrogenation; Pollution; Salts; Solvents; Toxic materials; Volatile organic compounds; Diels Alder Reaction; Green chemistry; Greenness; Ionic Liquids; Life cycle assessment; Melting point; Thermodynamic properties",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645634856

Most existing metrics rely on information about material and energy inputs and emissions from the main process and selected processes in its life cycle. Such metrics often result in multiple conflicting variables, making it difficult to use them for decision making. Furthermore, sustainability metrics need to be scientifically rigorous and capable of evaluating the broader economy and ecosystem scale impacts of selected processes and products. This paper proposes a framework for evaluating the environmental sustainability of industrial processes that satisfies these needs. This framework uses exergy analysis to combine different types of material and energy streams in a thermodynamically sound manner. Exergy analysis is also combined with end-point life-cycle impact assessment methods for evaluating the impact of emissions. This results in metrics for a selected system with different levels of aggregation ranging from multiple to single dimensions. The challenge of analyzing a process at life cycle and coarser spatial scales is met by combining exergy analysis, life cycle assessment, input-output analysis, and both economic and ecological aspects. The result is a doubly nested hierarchy, which analyzes processes at multiple spatial scales of process, life cycle, economy, and ecosystem. Each scale contains another hierarchy based on the degree of aggregation of the metrics.

Although this basic concept is quite straightforward, its implications are potentially profound. H.T. Odum pioneered the development and use of emergy, and presented it as a way of understanding the behavior of self-organized systems, valuing ecological goods and services, and jointly analyzing ecological and economic systems. Unfortunately, like many groundbreaking ideas, emergy has encountered a lot of resistance and criticism, particularly from economists, physicists, and engineers. Some critics have focused on detailed practical aspects of the approach, while others have taken issue with specific parts of the theory and claims. This paper discusses the main features and criticisms of emergy and provides insight into the relationship between emergy and concepts from engineering thermodynamics, such as exergy and cumulative exergy consumption. This reveals the close link between emergy and ecological cumulative exergy consumption, and indicates that most of the criticisms of emergy are either common to all holistic approaches that account for ecosystems and other macrosystems within their systems boundaries, or a result of misunderstandings derived from a lack of communication between various disciplines, or are not relevant for engineering applications. By identifying the main points of criticisms of emergy, this paper attempts to clarify many of the common misconceptions about emergy, inform the community of emergy practitioners about the aspects that need to be communicated better or improved, and suggest solutions. Further research and interaction with other disciplines is essential to bring one of H.T.

Previous work has demonstrated the utility of our multiscale detection scheme applied to linear projection-based methods, such as PCA and Dynamic PCA. This work further demonstrates the use and method independence of the multiscale scheme by applying it to a nonlinear modeling method, namely Adaptive Resonance Theory-2. The multiscale ART-2 (MSART-2) algorithm detects a process change when one or more wavelet coefficients violate the similarity thresholds with respect to clusters of wavelet coefficients under normal process operation at that scale. In contrast to most other multiresolution schemes, this framework exploits clustering behavior of wavelet coefficients of multiple variables for the purpose of scale selection and feature extraction. By reconstructing the signal with only the relevant scales, MSART-2 can automatically extract the signal feature representing the abnormal operation under consideration. Illustrative examples as well as Monte Carlo bases for these claims via a comparative performance analysis over several case studies are provided. Comparison of average detection delays or run-lengths of MSART-2 with those of ART-2 for a variety of processes with different statistical characteristics is provided. Comparative results on real industrial case studies from a petrochemical process plant are also presented. Results indicate that MSART-2, as compared to ART-2, is a general approach that may be preferable for problems where it is necessary to detect all changes drawn from processes of various statistical characteristics. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Adaptive resonance theory; Average run-length; Fault detection; Process monitoring; Statistical process control; Wavelets","Computer simulation; Extraction; Monte Carlo methods; Nonlinear systems; Petrochemical plants; Multiresolution ART network; Performance analysis; Projection-based methods; Wavelet coefficients; Signal processing; wave; adaptive resonance theory 2; algorithm; article; automation; cluster analysis; fault detection; image reconstruction; Monte Carlo method; nonlinear system; optical resolution; petrochemical industry; problem solving; process design; signal detection; statistical analysis; waveform; Yarrowia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3943101198

This paper develops a novel thermodynamic accounting framework for including the contribution of natural capital via thermodynamic input-output analysis. This framework is applied to the 1992 US economy comprising 91 industry sectors, resulting in delineation of the myriad ways in which sectors of the US economy rely on ecosystem products and services. The contribution of ecosystems is represented via the concept of ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC), which is related to emergy analysis but avoids any of its controversial assumptions and claims. The use of thermodynamics permits representation of all kinds of inputs and outputs in consistent units, facilitating the definition of aggregate metrics. Total ECEC requirement indicates the extent to which each economic sector relies directly and indirectly on ecological inputs. The ECEC/money ratio indicates the relative monetary versus ecological throughputs in each sector, and indicates the relationship between the thermodynamic work needed to produce a product or service and the corresponding economic activity. This ratio is found to decrease along economic supply chains, indicating industries that are higher up in the economic food chain price ecosystem contribution more than the basic infrastructure industries such as mining and manufacturing. The ratio of CEC with and without inclusion of ecosystems indicates the extent to which conventional thermoeconomic analysis underestimates the contribution of ecosystems. Such ratios, made available for the first time, provide unique insight into the importance of natural capital, and are especially useful in hybrid thermodynamic life cycle analysis of industrial systems. The approach, data compiled in this work, and the resulting insight provide a more ecologically conscious tool for environmental decision-making, and has potential applications at micro as well as macro scales.",,"Data acquisition; Decision making; Energy utilization; Environmental engineering; Industrial applications; Thermodynamics; Ecological cumulative energy consumption (ECEC); Industrial systems; Thermodynamic accounting; Ecosystems; ecosystem approach; environmental economics; input-output analysis; sustainable development; article; chemical analysis; decision making; economic aspect; economics; ecosystem; life cycle; thermodynamics; United States; Accounting; Costs and Cost Analysis; Economics; Ecosystem; Industry; Models, Economic; United States; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544354263

It has also been extended for life cycle assessment and sustainability evaluation of industrial products and processes. Although these extensions recognize the importance of capital and labor inputs and environmental impact, most of them ignore the crucial role that ecosystems play in sustaining all industrial activity. Decisions based on approaches that take nature for granted continue to cause significant deterioration in the ability of ecosystems to provide goods and services that are essential for every human activity. Accounting for nature's contribution is also important for determining the impact and sustainability of industrial activity. In contrast, energy analysis, a thermodynamic method from systems ecology, does account for ecosystems, but has encountered a lot of resistance and criticism, particularly from economists, physicists, and engineers. This paper expands the engineering concept of Cumulative Exergy Consumption (CEC) analysis to include the contribution of ecosystems, which leads to the concept of Ecological Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ECEC). Practical challenges in computing ECEC for industrial processes are identified and a formal algorithm based on network algebra is proposed. ECEC is shown to be closely related to emergy, and both concepts become equivalent if the analysis boundary, allocation method, and approach for combining global energy inputs are identical. This insight permits combination of the best features of emergy and exergy analysis, and shows that most of the controversial aspects of emergy analysis need not hinder its use for including the exergetic contribution of ecosystems.

Bayesian formulation of the estimation problem suggests a general solution for all types of systems. Even though the theory of Bayesian estimation of nonlinear dynamic systems has been available for 4 decades, practical implementation has not been feasible because of computational and methodological challenges. Consequently, most existing methods rely on simplifying assumptions to obtain a tractable but approximate solution. For example, extended Kalman filtering linearizes the process model and assumes Gaussian prior and noise. Moving-horizon-based least-squares estimation also assumes Gaussian or other fixed-shape prior and noise to obtain a least-squares optimization problem. This approach can impose constraints but is nonrecursive and requires computationally expensive nonlinear or quadratic programming. This paper introduces sequential Monte Carlo sampling for Bayesian estimation of chemical process systems. This recent approach approximates computationally expensive integration by recursive Monte Carlo sampling and can obtain posterior distributions accurately and efficiently with minimum assumptions. This approach has not been compared with estimation methods popular for chemical processes including moving-horizon estimation. In addition to comparing various methods, this paper also develops a novel empirical Bayes approach to deal with practical challenges due to degeneracy and a poor initial guess. The ability of the proposed approach to be more computationally efficient and at least as accurate as moving-horizon-based least-squares estimation is demonstrated via several case studies.",,"Integration; Kalman filtering; Least squares approximations; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Nonlinear systems; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Problem solving; Quadratic programming; Bayesian estimation; Nonlinear dynamic systems; Chemical elements; mathematical modeling; modeling; article; Bayes theorem; chemical engineering; chemical process; filtration; intermethod comparison; Kalman filtering; model; Monte Carlo method; nonlinear system; normal distribution; process model; regression analysis; sampling; unconstrained nonlinear dynamic system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042733565

For example, Shewhart charts are best for detecting large, localized changes, while EWMA and CUSUM charts are best for detecting small changes at coarse scales. A multiscale approach for SPC, adaptable to the scale of relevant signal features and developed based on wavelet analysis, detects abnormal events at multiple scales as relatively large wavelet coefficients. Univariate and multivariate multiscale SPC (MSSPC) for detecting abnormal operation are theoretically analyzed, and their properties are compared with existing SPC methods based on their average run lengths. SPC methods are best for detecting features over a narrow range of scales. Their performance can deteriorate rapidly if abnormal features lie outside this limited range. Since in most industrial processes, the nature of abnormal features is not known a priori, MSSPC performs better on average due to its adaptability to the scale of the features and for monitoring autocorrelated measurements since dyadic wavelets decorrelate most stochastic processes. MSSPC with dyadic discretization is appropriate for SPC of highly autocorrelated or nonstationary stochastic processes. If normal measurements are uncorrelated or contain only mild autocorrelation, it is better to use MSSPC with integer or uniformly discretized wavelets. Many existing methods such as MA, EWMA, CUSUM, Shewhart, batch means charts, and their multivariate extensions are special cases of MSSPC.",,"Frequencies; Measurements; Performance; Random processes; Shewhart charts; Wavelet transforms; data; article; chemical engineering; petrochemical industry; process control; theoretical study; waveform",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037392450

Maximum likelihood PCA (MLPCA) is an extension that accounts for different noise contributions in each variable. Neither PCA nor any of its extensions utilizes external information about the model or data, such as the range or distribution of the underlying measurements. Such prior information can be extracted from measured data and can be used to greatly enhance the model accuracy. This paper develops a Bayesian PCA (BPCA) modeling algorithm that improves the accuracy of estimating the parameters and measurements by incorporating prior knowledge about the data and model. The proposed approach integrates modeling and feature extraction by simultaneously solving parameter estimation and data reconciliation optimization problems. Methods for estimating the prior parameters from available data are discussed. Furthermore, BPCA reduces to PCA or MLPCA when a uniform prior is used. Several examples illustrate the benefits of BPCA versus existing methods even when the measurements violate the assumptions about their distribution.

This paper reviews the current status of statistical tools available for gene expression analysis, with emphasis on Bayesian approaches and multiscale wavelet filtering. Fundamental concepts of Bayesian and multiscale modeling are discussed from the perspective of their potential to address important issues related to the analysis of gene expression data, such as the fact that genomic data often have non-Gaussian distributions and feature localization and multiple scales in both frequency and measurement dimension. Recent publications in these areas are reviewed. Wavelet filtering and the advantages of multiscale methods are demonstrated by application to publicly available gene expression data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Multiscale methods, including multiscale principal component analysis (MSPCA), are applied to extract gene subsets and to visualize data in multidimensions for comparisons.

In MPCA and DISSIM, an abnormal operation can be detected by monitoring the directions of principal components and the dissimilarity index, respectively. Another important extension of MSPC was made with Multiscale PCA (MS-PCA). The present work investigates the characteristics of several statistical monitoring methods. The monitoring performance is compared with applications to simulated data obtained from a 2 × 2 process and the Tennessee Eastman process. The superiority of MPCA and DISSIM over the conventional methods comes from the fact that those methods focus on changes in the distribution of process data.

Traditional process engineering methods fall short of meeting this need due to their treating the environment as being secondary to economic objectives. Life cycle assessment and design methods broaden the scope of traditional methods, but focus primarily on the environmental impact of emissions while ignoring the contribution of ecological products and services. Taking nature for granted could provide misleading results since natural products and processes are a significant contributor to all industrial products and processes. Methods from systems ecology do account for ecological inputs, but ignore the impact of emissions. This paper presents an original approach for the joint analysis of industrial and ecological systems. This approach considers inputs from both ecological and economic resources, as well as the impact of emissions. It uses thermodynamics to exploit the synergy between methods from process systems engineering, systems ecology, and life cycle assessment to overcome the shortcomings of methods from each field. The approach is based on the fact that growth and sustenance of both industrial and ecological processes are limited by the available energy and its conversion to useful work. Thus, the embodied energy (emergy), that is, the energy used directly or indirectly to make a product or service is a thermodynamic measure of ecological investment or cost, while exergy loss provides a holistic measure of the impact of emissions. Together, emergy and exergy analysis can provide insight into the environmental performance and sustainability of the industrial process or product. The proposed framework is broadly applicable to assist decision making in chemical and other engineering tasks. Challenges and research opportunities for making this framework practical are identified. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In contrast, most existing methods for fault detection are best for detecting events at only one scale. This paper provides experimental validation and insight into a new method of process fault detection based on the integration of multiscale signal representation and scale-specific clustering-based diagnosis. The multiscale ART-2 (MSART-2) algorithm models normal process operation as clusters of wavelet coefficients at different scales. It detects a process change when one or more wavelet coefficients of test data violate similarity thresholds with respect to clusters of normal data at that scale. Especially in industrial situations where the nature of the abnormal features is not known a priori, MSART provides better average performance due to its ability to adapt to the scale of the features. In contrast to most other multiresolution schemes, this framework exploits clustering behavior of wavelet coefficients of multiple variables for the purpose of scale selection and feature extraction.

Furthermore, process data usually contain multiscale features due to different localizations in time and frequency. Existing methods for rectifying dynamic data require an accurate dynamic process model and are best for rectifying single-scale data. This paper presents a multiscale Bayesian approach for rectification of measurements from linear steady-state or dynamic processes with a steady-state model or without a model. This approach exploits the ability of wavelets to approximately decorrelate many autocorrelated stochastic processes and to extract deterministic features in a signal. The decorrelation ability results in wavelet coefficients at each scale that contain almost none of the process dynamics. Consequently, these wavelet coefficients can be rectified without a model or with a steady-state process model. The dynamics are captured in the wavelet domain by the scale-dependent variance of the wavelet coefficients and the last scaled signal. The proposed approach uses a scale-dependent prior for rectifying the wavelet coefficients and rectifies the last scaled signal without a model. In addition to more accurate rectification than existing methods, the multiscale Bayesian approach can eliminate the less relevant scales from the rectification before actually rectifying the data, resulting in significant savings in computation. This paper focuses on the rectification of Gaussian errors, but the approach is general and can be easily extended to other types of error distributions.A common situation in chemical processes is that the measured data come from a dynamic process, but the available accurate process models only represent steady-state behavior.

Selection of an appropriate method for a given task requires deep understanding of the characteristics of a variety of empirical modeling methods that have been derived from diverse fields such as statistics, chemometrics, and artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the necessary insight into the plethora of empirical modeling methods is not easily available, making the selection process subjective and heuristic, often resulting in inferior empirical models. Furthermore, the properties of various methods are complementary, and combining these methods can result in better models. This paper presents a common framework for understanding the similarities and differences between various empirical modeling methods, and for developing hybrid techniques that combine the best properties of existing methods. The framework is based on representing all empirical modeling methods as a weighted sum of basis functions, and comparing various methods depending on decisions about the nature of the input transformation, type of activation functions, and optimization criteria. All empirical modeling methods transform the inputs by projection on a linear or nonlinear hypersurface or by selecting a subset of variables. The activation functions are of fixed or adaptive shape, and the optimization criteria for determining the model parameters are based on either the input space only, or both input and output space.

Linear filters are most popular for online filtering; however, they are single-scale best suited for rectifying data containing features and noise that are at the same resolution in time and frequency. Consequently, for multiscale data, linear filters are forced to trade off the extent of noise removal with the accuracy of the features retained. In contrast, nonlinear filtering methods, such as FMH and wavelet thresholding, are multiscale, but they cannot be used for online rectification. A technique is presented for online nonlinear filtering based on wavelet thresholding.

Gross errors are removed by combining wavelet thresholding with multiscale median filtering. Theoretical analysis shows that OLMS rectification using Haar wavelets subsumes mean filters of dyadic length, while rectification with smoother boundary corrected wavelets is analogous to adaptive exponential smoothing.

Consequently, data analysis and modeling methods that represent the measured variables at multiple scales are better suited for extracting information from measured data than methods that represent the variables at a single scale. This paper presents an overview of multiscale data analysis and empirical modeling methods based on wavelet analysis. These methods exploit the ability of wavelets to extract events at different scales, compress deterministic features in a small number of relatively large coefficients, and approximately decorrelate a variety of stochastic processes. Multiscale data analysis methods for off-line and on-line removal of Gaussian stationary noise eliminate coefficients smaller than a threshold. These methods are extended to removing non-Gaussian errors by combining them with multiscale median filtering. Multiscale empirical modeling methods simultaneously select the most relevant features while determining the model parameters, and may provide more accurate and physically interpretable models.

The framework is then used to unify methods that combine inputs by linear projection before applying the basis function.

Due to its multiscale nature, MSPCA is appropriate for the modeling of data containing contributions from events whose behavior changes over time and frequency. Process monitoring by MSPCA involves combining only those scales where significant events are detected, and is equivalent to adoptively filtering the scores and residuals, and adjusting the detection limits for easiest detection of deterministic changes in the measurements. Approximate decorrelation of wavelet coefficients also makes MSPCA effective for monitoring autocorrelated measurements without matrix augmentation or time-series modeling.

Existing methods for rectification represent the measured variables at a single scale in the time or frequency domain. This representation is inefficient for rectification of data containing multiscale features such as, contributions from events of different duration in time and frequency, and non-white stochastic errors. In this paper, a new class of methods is developed for the rectification of random errors based on representing the measured variables at multiple scales by decomposition on time-frequency localized basis functions derived from orthonormal wavelets. A new technique is developed for the on-line rectification of stationary random errors in the absence of fundamental or empirical process models. This rectification method eliminates basis function coefficients smaller than a threshold, and provides better rectification than that by the widely used method of exponential smoothing. The threshold for rectification is derived from a multiscale model of the errors, which may he estimated from the mulliscalc decomposition of the measured data. If multiple redundant measured variables are available, then the data may be rectified by extracting an empirical model relating the variables, by methods such as principal components analysis. A new multiscale PCA method is developed that provides better rectification than PCA, by simultaneously extracting the relationship among the variables and among the measurements.

A detour through the basic concepts of scale-space filtering is necessary in order to see the connection between the concept of process trends and the classical material on signal analysis. It introduces the theory of the multiresolution analysis of signals using wavelet decomposition that is used to provide the scalespace image of a function with correct local characteristics. This localized description of a signal's features allows the correct extraction of distinguished attributes from a signal, a task that forms the basis for the inductive generation of pattern-based logical relationships among input and output variables, or the efficient compaction of process data. Of particular value is the construction of “translationally invariant” wavelet decompositions that allow the correct formation of temporal patterns in process variables. The use of wavelet decomposition as the most appropriate framework for the extraction and representation of trends of process operating data has been discussed. The chapter presents development of an efficient methodology for the compression of process data. Of particular importance is the conceptual foundation of the data compression algorithm; instead of seeking noninterpretable, numerical compaction of data, it strives for an explicit retention of distinguished features in a signal. It is shown that this approach is both numerically efficient and amenable to explicit interpretations of historical process trends. It also discusses how the temporal distinguished features of many input and output signals can be correlated in propositional forms to provide logical rules for the diagnosis and control of processes that are difficult to model. The chapter provides illustrations on the use of the various techniques, using real-world case studies. © 1995 Academic Press Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849202899

The analysis not only attempts to justify the development of the Wave-Net but also refines its operational characteristics. The motivation for studying the functional estimation problem is the derivation of a modeling framework suitable for process control. The problem of deriving an estimate of an unknown function from empirical data is posed and studied in a theoretical level. Then, the problem is formulated in mathematical terms and the sources of the error related to any proposed solution to the estimation problem are identified. The chapter formulates basic algorithm whose new element is the pointwise presentation of the data and the dynamic evolution of the solution itself. The need for a multi-resolution framework in representing the unknown function is recognized and the wavelet transform is proposed as the essential vehicle to satisfy this requirement. The complete algorithm has been presented and identified as the modified Wave-Net model. Modeling examples demonstrate the properties of the derived solution. © 1995, Academic Press Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042482544

The extraction, though, of the 'pivotal' temporal features from operating data is not a trivial task for two reasons: the localization in time of the operating features, and the multi-scale character of operating trends. This paper introduces an integrated systematic approach, based on the wavelet decomposition of batch records of operating variables, which accomplishes the following goals: (1) It extracts the temporal features of the process trends at various time-scales. (2) It generalizes the multi-scale description of operating variables, by identifying the common features among many records of these operating variables. (3) It establishes relationships among the temporal patterns of operating variables, thus leading to pattern-based diagnosis and control of batch operations. Data from an industrial batch fermentor are used to illustrate the ideas of the proposed approach and its value for evaluating batch operations. © 1994.",,"Chemical plants; Failure analysis; Manufacture; Pattern recognition; SCADA systems; Batch operations; Fault diagnosis; Temporal features; Wavelet decomposition; Process control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028546521

The good localization characteristics of the basis functions, both in the input and frequency domains, allow hierarchical, multiresolution learning of input‐output maps from experimental data. Furthermore, Wave‐Nets allow explicit estimation for global and local prediction error‐bounds, and thus lend themselves to a rigorous and explicit design of the network. This article presents the mathematical framework for the development of Wave‐Nets and discusses the various aspects of their practical implementation. Computational complexity arguments prove that the training and adaptation efficiency of Wave‐Nets is at least an order of magnitude better than other networks. In addition, it presents two examples on the application of Wave‐Nets; (a) the prediction of a chaotic time‐series, representing population dynamics, and (b) the classification of experimental data for process fault diagnosis.
