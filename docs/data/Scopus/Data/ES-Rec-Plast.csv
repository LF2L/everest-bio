Concomitantly, two emerging topics are currently gaining interest due to their potential to implement systematic shifts and contribute to achieving the SDG – Circular Economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0). This research performed a systematic literature review to identify how the CE-I4.0 nexus, the combination of CE practices and I4.0 technologies, could contribute to achieving the SDG. A total of 50 peer-review articles that addressed the simultaneous or individual link between CE and I4.0 to sustainability form the review portfolio. The articles were first screened with regard to the I4.0 technologies and CE practices applied, and further analyzed in order to understand the stronger links to the SDG. Findings show that the CE-I4.0 nexus directly benefits SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, and SDG 13. The specific targets addressed by the combined implementation of CE practices and I4.0 technologies are disclosed and discussed. We argue that the CE-I4.0 nexus is pivotal in the endeavors to reach the SDG, as it connects innovative technologies with novel circular production and business models, which ultimately brings the opportunity to tackle the SDG targets intensified in this study. Further research could quantitatively address the impacts of the CE-I4.0 nexus, investigate secondary effects on the SDG, or develop further case studies under the CE-I4.0 umbrella. © 2020","Circular economy; Industry 4.0; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals","Industry 4.0; Planning; Sustainable development; Business models; Case-studies; Circular economy; Emerging topics; Innovative technology; Peer review; Sustainable practices; Systematic literature review; Industrial economics","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85092703098",NA,NA

This also applies to the present century and its sustainability challenges at the planetary, regional and local levels. Therefore, it is of great importance and relevance to move forward on the journey which has been started globally to address the not insignificant number of challenges. It is however essential to go beyond descriptive work by continuing with novel, inspiring and interconnected steps to find solutions to overcome these challenges. As this huge task also requires multidimensional communication, understanding and actions across different regions, cultures, disciplines and knowledge areas, the development of a common conceptual framework such as the concept of bioeconomy has been accepted globally as very valuable. The momentum which has been created in more than 50 countries around the world by the growing number of activities, initiatives and strategies in bioeconomy is very encouraging. This offers great opportunities to mobilize even more stakeholders in science and industry, as well as society, to join the bioeconomy journey. Strategic high-level concepts such as preserving the value of the natural capital of planet earth, connecting economy and ecology, sustaining the boundary conditions and habitability of our biosphere are highly important. It is also essential on the bioeconomy journey to connect with highly specific and actionable missions, programs and plans towards sustainable economic growth under the boundary conditions of our planet. © 2020","Bioeconomy; Ecology; Habitability; Natural capital; Planetary boundary conditions; Sustainability; Sustainable economic growth","Boundary conditions; Earth (planet); Economics; Technology transfer; Conceptual frameworks; Knowledge areas; Natural capital; Planet earth; Step changes; Sustainable economic growth; Bioeconomy; article; astronomy; biosphere; conceptual framework; ecology; human; sustainable growth","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85096653392",NA,NA

In recent decades, global fish production experienced sustained growth and peaked at about 179 million tonnes in 2018. Consequently, increased interest in the environmental implications of fishery products along the supply chain, namely from capture to end of life, was recently experienced by society, industry and policy-makers. This timely review aims to describe the current framework of LCA and its application to the seafood sector that mainly focused on fish extraction and processing, but it also encompassed the remaining stages. An excess of 60 studies conducted over the last decade, along with some additional publications, were comprehensively reviewed; these focused on the main LCA methodological choices, including but not limited to, functional unit, system boundaries allocation methods and environmental indicators. The review identifies key recommendations on the progression of LCA for this increasingly important sustaining seafood sector. Specifically, these recommendations include (i) the need for specific indicators for fish-related activities, (ii) the target species and their geographical origin, (iii) knowledge and technology transfer and, (iv) the application and implementation of key recommendations from LCA research that will improve the accuracy of LCA models in this sector. Furthermore, the review comprises a section addressing previous and current challenges of the seafood sector. Wastewater treatment, ghost fishing or climate change, are also the objects of discussion together with advocating support for the water-energy-food nexus as a valuable tool to minimize environmental negativities and to frame successful synergies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental impacts; Fisheries; Life cycle assessment; Nexus; Seafood; Sustainability","Climate change; Fish; Fish products; Fisheries; Meats; Supply chains; Technology transfer; Wastewater treatment; Allocation methods; Environmental implications; Environmental indicators; Functional units; Geographical origins; Knowledge and technology transfer; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Processed products; Life cycle; environmental impact; fishery management; fishery production; life cycle analysis; seafood; sustainability; attention; climate change; environmental impact; environmental indicator; extraction; fishing; hydropower; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; review; sea food; target organism; technology; waste water management; animal; climate change; life cycle stage; Animals; Climate Change; Life Cycle Stages; Seafood","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85099203031",NA,NA

Although the concept of CE refers to various natural resources such as water and land, little is known on how current CE policies are integrating these environmental resources. This article assesses how water and land concerns are embedded in the EU CE action plans issued in 2015 and 2020 and a set of nine member states’ subsequent national plans. The assessment used a content analysis based on two variables, the frequency of water and land’ related terms and the consistency of their inclusion within the plans. The findings reveal that neither water nor land emerge as major concerns in the CE plans, in comparison to materials or waste. Also, they are not consistently associated with the typical components of the plans namely problem-showcase, objectives, strategies and measures, stakeholders, and CE performance indicators. Nevertheless, the embeddedness of water is more evident in the plans of southern countries, whereas land concerns are much more erratic. If water and land concerns, are to be at the forefront of the transition to circularity, as the literature recommends, and if these plans are expected to offer an integrated approach of the CE concept, further efforts should be made to ensure their embeddedness. © 2020","Action plans; Circular economy; Land; Water","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Circular economy; Content analysis; Embeddedness; Environmental resources; European union; Integrated approach; Performance indicators; Strategies and measures; Economic and social effects","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85098888327",NA,NA

Although the ecological and functional role of birds in terrestrial areas, islands in particular, has been deeply studied since the last century, the same does not hold true for coastal marine areas. Given the importance of coastal areas for seabirds worldwide and, at the same time, the high vulnerability of both, looking into the role of seabirds in influencing the ecosystem functioning in coastal areas is needed nowadays. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the role of seabirds on coastal ecological processes giving particular emphasis on the linkage between the seabird functions that are crucial in influencing the ecological processes and the provision of ecosystem services, and disservices, for the human well-being. Seabirds can contribute to shaping coastal ecological processes and services in a multitude of ways, among which directly influencing trophic status, environmental contamination, biodiversity and food webs through trophic (bottom-up or top-down) and non-trophic processes.

While this move is regarded as a solution to plastic pollution, it may shift or create detrimental impacts elsewhere in the production, consumption, management system, a possibility that is underexplored. The aim of the present study is to identify the potential challenges and trade-offs associated with the introduction of bio-based plastics in the food packaging industry, and highlight issues relevant to policy and decision-making processes. We employ a whole system approach to review the literature and assess holistically the performance of bio-based plastics, which looks at the entire lifecycle of bio-based plastic packaging (i.e. production, consumption, management) and considers wider aspects in the environmental, economic, social and technical sustainability domains. Based on our findings, we developed, and present herein, a sustainability decision matrix, a novel guiding tool, which can provide important insights into the potential impacts of the introduction of larger amount of bio-based plastic food packaging in the future and support decision-making processes. In conclusion, our preliminary high-level assessment of the bio-based plastics production, use and management system clearly reveals a number of blind-spots across the entire system that are currently ignored by the use of single-dimensional approaches. This highlights that the sustainability assessment of specific bio-based polymers requires thorough and further research that takes into account the type of feedstock, infrastructure availability, and interactions between sustainability domains, to ensure that the substitution of petrochemical-based plastics with bio-based alternatives in food packaging sector will not lead to unintended consequences. © 2020","Bioplastics; Holistic view; Life cycle; Plastic waste management; Plastics; Sustainability","Chemical contamination; Commerce; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Elastomers; Life cycle; Packaging; Packaging machines; Plastic products; Pollution; Sustainable development; Bio-based polymers; Decision making process; Food packaging industry; Management systems; Plastic pollutions; Plastics production; Sustainability assessment; Unintended consequences; Plastics industry","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85098064421",NA,NA

The expected increase in plastic pollution (including MPs) may elevate the risk posed by these synthetic particles to both environmental and human health. The purpose of this review is to provide a review of the state of knowledge regarding the occurrence and transport of MPs in and across three of the Earths subsystems, specifically, the lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. Evidence is presented that shows the lithosphere includes substantial MP accumulation (e.g. approximately 25 particles L−1 in landfill leachate), the impacts of which remain poorly understood. The atmosphere plays an important role in MP transport, with increased occurrence and higher transport concentrations noted in more densely populated areas (e.g. 175 to 313 particles m−2 d−1 in Dongguan China). In the hydrosphere, freshwater ecosystems alternate between MP transport (e.g. rivers) and deposition (e.g. lakes) with flow rate being identified as a key factor determining the movement and fate of MPs. Conversely, marine ecosystems act as a major sink for MP pollution (e.g. MP comprise 94%, approximately 1.69 trillion pieces, of plastic pieces in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch), driven by direct deposition or by transport via the atmosphere or freshwater conveyance systems (e.g. streams, rivers, or ice sheets). Once ingested by organisms, the trophic transfer and bioaccumulation of MPs has been confirmed with the polymer particles potentially accumulating in or impacting fauna, flora, microbes, and humans. Finally, 16 areas are identified in which future MP research efforts should be focused, with the goal of accurately identifying the scope and potential risks posed by synthetic polymer pollution. This review serves as a valuable steppingstone for future research and researchers wishing to address MP research gaps across various environmental settings in the coming decades. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atmosphere; Biosphere; Environmental subsystems; Hydrosphere; Lithosphere; Micro-plastics; Plastic pollution; Pollutant transport; Research needs","Biochemistry; Deposition; Ecosystems; Health risks; Hydrosphere; Lake pollution; Leachate treatment; Marine pollution; Microplastic; Polymers; Water; Conveyance systems; Direct deposition; Freshwater ecosystem; Landfill leachates; Plastic pollutions; Polymer particles; Research efforts; Synthetic polymers; River pollution; cellulose acetate; microplastic; polyamide; polyethylene; polyethylene terephthalate; polypropylene; polystyrene; polyvinylchloride; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); hydrosphere; lithosphere; plastic waste; pollutant transport; source apportionment; water pollution; atmosphere; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; China; concentration (parameter); environmental factor; environmental impact; fauna; flora; flow rate; freshwater environment; human; hydrosphere; knowledge; landfill leachate; lithosphere; marine environment; microorganism; microplastic pollution; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; China; Dongguan; Guangdong","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85097708107",NA,NA

However, the relevant reports in wetland ecosystems, the boundary area between water and land, are still rare. Where are the sources and sinks of MPs in the wetland? The latest researches have shown that the sources of MPs in wetlands include sewage discharge, surface runoff, and plastic wastes from aquaculture. Fibers and fragments are the most common shapes, and PE, PP, PS can be detected in water or sediment matrices, and biota of wetlands. The distribution is affected by hydrodynamic conditions, sediment properties, and vegetation coverage. Factors affecting the vertical migration of MPs include their own physical and chemical properties, the combination of substances that accelerate deposition (mineral adsorption and biological flocculation), and resuspension. Minerals tend to adsorb negatively charged MPs while algae aggregates have a preference for positively charged MPs. The wetlands vegetation can trap MPs and affect their migration. In water matrices, MPs are ingested by organisms and integrated into sediments, which makes them seem undetectable in the wetland ecosystem. Photodegradation and microbial degradation can further reduce the MPs in size. Although recent research has increased, we are still searching for a methodological harmonization of the detection practices and exploring the migration rules and fate patterns of MPs. Our work is the first comprehensive review of the source, distribution, migration, and fate of MPs in wetland ecosystems. It reveals the uniqueness of wetland habitat in the research of MPs and indicates the potential of wetlands acting as sources or sinks for MPs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Distribution; Fate; Microplastics; Migration; Source; Wetland ecosystems","Aquatic ecosystems; Biodegradation; Microplastic; Photodegradation; Sediments; Sewage; Vegetation; Biological flocculations; Hydrodynamic conditions; Microbial degradation; Physical and chemical properties; Positively charged; Sediment properties; Terrestrial ecosystems; Vegetation coverage; Wetlands; aquatic ecosystem; biodegradation; environmental fate; hydrodynamics; photodegradation; plastic waste; pollutant source; pollutant transport; source-sink dynamics; terrestrial ecosystem; wetland","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85096622164",NA,NA

The review identifies different types of catalyst, obstacles and ambivalent factors influencing circular economy implementation in business. This study contributes to research on circular economy implementation at business organizations by providing understanding on the role of these factors in supporting or hindering the change. This study also opens discussion on ambivalent factors that in certain contexts can act as a catalyst to and in others as a hindrance to circular economy. This understanding further enables identification of the origins of these different types of factors, especially concerning their intraorganizational or interorganizational role.

Exergy is defined by literature as the amount of useful work that can be derived from a real system when it is brought into equilibrium with its environment. In the literature, it is considered an outstanding concept that can be applied to enhance the effectiveness of ordinary evaluation models such as LCA. The literature proposes a variety of hybrid approaches that combine Exergetic Analysis (EA) and LCA with different combination frameworks. The aim of this paper is to describe the potential of each hybrid method and to characterize the degree of interoperability between EA and LCA that each of them can provide. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks that seem to be too challenging to overcome: a variety of inconsistencies in the interpretation of the results due to the difficulty of the inventory phase and the ambiguity in the choice of the correct alternative in the standard databases; the link with old techniques that refers to obsolete approaches in finding data that suit to the updated goals and scopes; the difficulty in conducting an assessment affected by the least possible uncertainty. Following a theoretical overview of the principles of each hybrid method that binds EA and LCA, the authors want to provide a review from a completely different point of view than the state-of-the-art literature, on how effectively EA and LCA can interact with each other in order to provide a more holistic view of the system/process to be assessed. The fascinating circumstance that emerges from the review is that any exergy approach would be more effective if joined (not replaced) to the standard LCA, because it turned out to be complementary. This theory has long been developed by many authors in their case studies as a confirmation of what Gutowski wrote years ago: no single alternative criteria or subsidiary model, independently of how well aggregated, may offer a suitable answer for all conditions. Specifically, through this review, the practitioners would be able to choose the best suited hybrid methodology, according to their aims, join the outcomes together and achieve a transdisciplinary knowledge of the behavior of the study case system, in order to design the best improvement strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Exergy; Hybrid methods; Integration modelling; Life cycle assessment; Process reversibility; Sustainable manufacturing","Exergy; Interoperability; Sustainable development; Evaluation models; Exergetic analysis; Hybrid methodologies; Improvement strategies; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle thinking; State of the art; Subsidiary models; Life cycle","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85095770647",NA,NA

However, the semi-closed GVP environment can lead to accumulation of soil contaminants and impose a threat to human health through consumption of vegetables. This paper reviews the current environmental soil status and vegetable safety in Chinese GVPs. Furthermore, we propose several lines of future research to better understand the sources and pathways of GVP contaminants and to identify alternative management to achieve sustainable development. Our review suggests that legacy agricultural practices, including intensive application of agrochemicals and frequent irrigation, have led to significant soil acidification and salinization, as well as accumulation of nutrients and emerging contaminants in human-altered and human-transported soils used for GVP and in GVP vegetables. Over fertilization has led to very low nutrient use efficiencies, particularly for phosphorus and nitrogen. In addition, high inputs of manure, plastic films, and pesticides have promoted significant accumulation of organochlorines, antibiotics, phthalic acid esters, and heavy metals in soils and vegetables at levels exceeding or close to their permitted environmental threshold values. Leafy vegetables with large surface area have the highest levels of contaminants which, in turn, can cause health risks to consumers. Nevertheless, the sources and the paths of contaminants entering the soils and vegetables have not been widely investigated, particularly in the southwestern and northern Chinese provinces. Future research should include detailed documentation of agrochemicals and soil properties involved in the retention, degradation, and mobilization of contaminants. Furthermore, new cleaning technologies should be taken in practice to mitigate or prevent contamination of soil and vegetables. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agrochemicals; Alternative management; Emerging contaminants; Environmental threshold; Human health risk; Nutrient use efficiency","agricultural management; agricultural production; anthropogenic effect; crop production; nutrient use efficiency; safety; soil quality; vegetable; China","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85095422131",NA,NA

Seagrass meadows are valuable but declining ecosystems due to local and global-change related stressors, including sediment disturbance and introduced macroalgae. Understanding whether plastics pose a further threat to seagrasses is critically important. In two simultaneous additive experiments performed in an aquaculture tank, we examined the individual and combined effects of macroplastics (non-biodegradable high-density polyethylene and biodegradable starch-based) and sedimentation (no and repeated sedimentation) on the performance (in terms of biomass and architectural variables) of a native Mediterranean seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) and an introduced macroalga (Caulerpa cylindracea), and on the intensity of their interactions. Macroplastics were still present in sediments after 18 months. Cymodocea nodosa produced a greater biomass and longer horizontal rhizome internodes forming clones with more spaced shoots probably to escape from plastics. Plastics prevented C. nodosa to react to sedimentation by increasing vertical rhizome growth. Under C. cylindracea invasion, C. nodosa allocated more biomass to roots, particularly to fine roots. In the presence of C. nodosa, C. cylindracea performance was reduced. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic and sedimentation shifted species interactions from competitive to neutral. These results suggest that both HDPE and biodegradable starch-based macroplastics, if deposited on marine bottoms, could make seagrasses vulnerable to sedimentation and reduce plant cover within meadows. HDPE plastic and sedimentation could contribute to the decline of seagrass habitats by facilitating the spread of non-native macroalgae within meadows. Overall, the study highlights the urgent need to implement more effective post-marketing management actions to prevent a further entering of plastics in natural environments in the future, as well as to establish to conservation measures specifically tailored to protect seagrass habitats from plastic pollution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biodegradable plastic; Biological invasion; Biotic resistance; Burial; High-density polyethylene; Plastic pollution","Aliphatic compounds; Biomass; Ecosystems; Elastomers; High density polyethylenes; Marketing; Plastic products; Sedimentation; Starch; Biodegradable starch; Conservation measures; High density polyethylene(HDPE); Marine environment; Marketing management; Natural environments; Plastic pollutions; Species interactions; Plants (botany); macroplastic; plastic; polyethylene; starch; plastic; biodegradation; biological invasion; introduced species; macroalga; plastic waste; polymer; seagrass meadow; sedimentation; aquaculture; Article; biodegradability; biomass; Caulerpa cylindracea; controlled study; environmental management; internode; macroalga; nonhuman; organismal interaction; plastic pollution; priority journal; rhizome; root growth; seagrass; sediment; sedimentation; shoot growth; Alismatales; ecosystem; seaweed; Caulerpa cylindracea; Cymodocea nodosa; Alismatales; Biomass; Ecosystem; Plastics; Seaweed","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85097072557",NA,NA

As a result, plastic waste can be found in all corners of the Earth. A class of plastic contaminants that have received increasing attention in terms of their potential impact on ecosystems is microplastics (≤5 mm). The greatest attention to date has been on their potential effect in marine ecosystems. However, a growing number of studies are examining their potential impact on soil ecosystems. The data reported in the literature on the environmentally-relevant concentrations of microplastics in soils and the concentration of microplastics that causes an adverse effect in soil biota were used to perform a probabilistic risk assessment of microplastics to soil biota. An environmental exposure distribution was constructed from the concentrations of microplastics reported in soil in the literature. Species sensitivity distributions were constructed using concentration of microplastics in soil that had no adverse effect on soil species (NOEC) or the lowest concentrations that had an adverse effect on soil species (LOEC) reported in the literature. The 95th centile of the environmental exposure distribution (8147 microplastic particles per gram of soil) was greater than 22 and 28% of the species sensitivity distribution constructed using NOECs and LOECs, respectively. The assessment concluded that environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics reported in the literature could pose a considerable risk to soil biota. It is also important to note that due to the continued production of large quantities of plastic and the persistence of microplastics in the environment, environmentally-relevant concentrations of microplastics in soil are likely to only rise. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Plants; Polyethylene; Polypropylene; Soil invertebrates; Soil microbial community","Ecosystems; Microplastic; Plastics applications; Plastics industry; Population distribution; Risk assessment; Environmental exposure; Microplastic particles; Potential effects; Potential impacts; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Soil ecosystems; Species sensitivity distributions; Strength to weight ratio; Soils; concentration (composition); microbial community; plastic waste; probability; risk assessment; soil ecosystem; soil quality; Invertebrata","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85097349885",NA,NA

More recently, business model innovation for the circular economy has caught the attention of business leaders and academics alike as the circular economy promises to deliver economic prosperity within ecological limits. Yet research on circular business models is nascent and the business literature gives limited attention to the challenges deriving from circular economy implementation. Using an integrative research approach and particularly, drawing on both paradox theory and circular economy principles and loops, this article provides a preliminary, conceptual systematisation of the typology of organisational tensions in circular economy implementation. It also discusses the relevance of these tensions from a business model perspective. As a result, this article contributes to circular economy research wherein challenges are mostly analysed at the macro level and in the absence of a specific theoretical anchoring. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Business model innovation; Circular economy; Corporate sustainability; Paradox","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Business leaders; Business model innovation; Business modeling; Circular economy; Economic prosperity; Integrative research approaches; Limited attentions; Systematisation; Ecology","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85094571886",NA,NA

Other coastal habitats, such as mangroves, remain understudied. Eighteen of the top twenty rivers that contribute the most plastic to the ocean are associated with mangroves, but very few of those forests were investigated in terms of plastic debris pollution. Here we discuss the results of the few available studies on macrodebris conducted in mangroves, which show that mangrove debris research is still in its early stages, with many areas of study to be further investigated. Indeed, the distinct structural complexity of mangroves increases their ability to trap debris from both terrestrial, freshwater and marine sources, resulting in impacts unique to the mangrove ecosystem. Our review highlights a significant lack in standardisation across the performed surveys. Here we suggest standardised guidelines for future integrated macrodebris and microplastic studies in mangroves to facilitate comparisons between studies. Such standardisation should prioritize the use of stratified random sampling, the measurement of the area covered by the debris and the abundance and type of macrodebris and microplastics found, in order to assess the ecological impact of macrodebris and its role as source of microplastics for adjacent ecosystems. We also advocate the use of standard categories across studies, based on those identified for surveying other coastal habitats. This review highlights an alarming knowledge gap in extent, sources and overall impacts of marine macrodebris, mainly constituted by plastic, on mangrove forests, which hinders policy making to address this issue. Standardised, reliable and extended research on this aspect of mangrove pollution is needed to manage and protect these endangered vegetated coastal ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal environments; Mangrove management; Marine litter; Microplastics; Plastic pollution; Solid waste","Debris; Forestry; Marine pollution; Microplastic; River pollution; Standardization; Surveys; Coastal ecosystems; Coastal habitats; Ecological impacts; Extended researches; Mangrove ecosystems; Plastic pollutions; Stratified random sampling; Structural complexity; Ecosystems; anthropogenic source; debris flow; environmental disturbance; literature review; mangrove; marine pollution; plastic waste; policy making; Rhizophoraceae","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85098160447",NA,NA

Several species feed on organic waste from these sites, but at the same time are exposed to non-organic materials. Species that can gather food in these sites might at the same time disperse waste consumed, but this has rarely been evaluated. We compare the occurrence of plastic debris in regurgitated pellets of three sympatric vultures from northwest Patagonia, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), black vultures (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), foraging in different degrees of humanized sites. We also evaluate the influence of rubbish dumps in the presence of plastic debris in pellets of the studied species and their potential role in spreading plastic to the environment. Most synthetic material present in pellets was plastic. Pellets of Andean condors, which avoid disturbed anthropic sites in this area, showed almost no plastic debris compared with the other sympatric vulture species, suggesting an influence of the foraging habits on plastic ingestion. For black and turkey vultures, we found that rubbish dumps may be an important source of plastic. The occurrence of plastic debris in pellets of black vultures sampled in 2010 and 2020 increased, probably associated with the increase in urbanization and waste production in the study area. Avian scavengers were exposed to and are able to transport plastic to distant communal roosts generating “plastic islands”. It is necessary to reduce plastic generation and better waste management practices to avoid species and environments to be affected by this pollutant. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Pellets; Plastic pollution; Rubbish dumps; Scavengers; Urbanization","Debris; Pelletizing; Waste management; Natural areas; Organic materials; Organic wastes; Plastic debris; Study areas; Synthetic materials; Waste management practices; Waste production; Plastics industry; biological uptake; foraging behavior; plastic waste; raptor; refuse; scavenger; urbanization; animal experiment; article; controlled study; foraging; habit; ingestion; nonhuman; plastic pollution; plastic waste; urbanization; vulture (bird); waste management; animal; bird; eating; island (geological); pollutant; Patagonia; Aves; Cathartes; Cathartes aura; Coragyps; Coragyps atratus; Vultur gryphus; plastic; Animals; Birds; Eating; Environmental Pollutants; Islands; Plastics","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85092105164",NA,NA

However, not much is studied about the individual level micro influence of these constructs on employee engagement (EE), organizational pride (OP), organizational identification (OI) and “desire to have a significant impact through work” (DSIW). Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR on EE, OP, OI and DSIW. Data collected from 320 non-managerial staff members employed at a garments manufacturing company in Pakistan was analyzed using partial least square (PLS) approach. Findings revealed that the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR plays an important role in shaping EE, OP, OI and DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry. Further, it is found that the implementation of CPP has a non-significant impact on SQ. Additionally, results of the importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) have also confirmed that the implementation of CPP at company level has shown a highest importance and performance amongst all the latent constructs proposed as predictors of DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry.

Macroplastics can cause entanglement, ingestion and loss of suitable habitats. In addition to entanglement problems, there is evidence that plastics are entering the food web through ingestion by marine organisms, which could ultimately be affecting humans. Much of the available information on the impact of plastic in biota is scattered and disconnected due to the use of different methodologies. Here, we review the variety of approaches and protocols followed to assess macro- and microplastic ingestion in marine vertebrates such as sea turtles, cetaceans and fishes in order to offer a global overview of their current status. The analysis of 112 studies indicates the highest plastic ingestion in organisms collected in the Mediterranean and Northeast Indian Ocean with significant differences among plastic types ingested by different groups of animals, including differences in colour and the type of prevalent polymers. In sea turtles, the most prevalent types of plastics are white plastics (66.60%), fibres (54.54%) and LDPE polymer (39.09%); in cetaceans, white macro- and microplastics (38.31%), fibres (79.95%) and PA polymer (49.60%); and in fishes, transparent plastics (45.97%), fibres (66.71%) and polyester polymer (36.20%). Overall, clear fibre microplastics are likely the most predominant types ingested by marine megafauna around the globe. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","apical consumers; global change; macroplastic; marine conservation; microplastic; predators","Cetacea; Cheloniidae; Pisces; Vertebrata","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85097205378",NA,NA

Because of its lower impacts on soil temperature, black film mulching (BFM) is being considered as an alternative to TFM. A meta-analysis was therefore conducted to compare the benefits and trade-offs of TFM and BFM use in potato, maize, and wheat production. Overall, the plant height, aboveground biomass, water use efficiency, and yield under plastic film mulching increased by 7–17 %, 27–59 %, 20–47 %, and 17–35 %, respectively. However, film mulching shortened the crop phenology by 4–9 % due to the higher soil temperature compared with non-mulching. Compared with TFM, the mean soil temperature over the crop growing season under BFM reduced by 1.1 °C, which resulted in a 3–5 % increase in phenology. This is a crucial factor for BFM to increase maize yield by 6% and improve marketable tuber rate of potato by 9%, which led to higher profits, compared with TFM. In addition, no herbicide was used in BFM system, thereby eliminating the costs of herbicide and its application. As a result, the net economic benefits in BFM were 5–11 % higher than those in TFM for crop production. In conclusion, the BFM system leads to greater crop growth and higher economic benefits than the TFM system, especially for maize and potato. Policies and investment incentives that support the promotion of BFM technology should be prioritized in order to pursue these greater benefits. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crop growth; Economic benefits; Soil temperature; Soil water; Yield","crop production; film; growing season; herbicide; maize; meta-analysis; mulching; phenology; plastic; potato; Solanum tuberosum","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85097472990",NA,NA

Further, UCLDs also become a socio-economic burden on the municipalities through the consumption of enormous land of the modern-day cities and creation of unhealthy living conditions for the surrounding populace. However, an increase in demand for the land to settle the ever-growing population of such cities and to meet the infrastructural requirements, the habitable boundaries of these cities are expanding, and hence mining of the UCLDs, termed as landfill mining, LFM, is being advocated. Apart from this, LFM facilitates the recovery of resources such as metals, plastics, glass and paper from the landfill mined residues, LMRs. Despite these advantages, LFM faces a significant challenge due to the creation of huge volumes of fine-fractions, separated from the LMRs, also known as ‘Landfill-Mined-Soil-like-Fractions’, LFMSF, which primarily is a conglomeration of organics, soils, debris and smaller chips of metals, plastics, and glass. Unfortunately, utilization of the LFMSF, as a manmade resource, has still not become a well-accepted practice. This is mainly due to the lack of understanding of the characteristics of the LFMSF that are mostly site-specific. With this in view, synthesis of the literature dealing with the issues related to the characterization and utilization of the LFMSF was conducted. It has been realized that by developing and following adequate characterization protocols and guidelines, the LFMSF can be utilized as a manmade resource for sustainable development, without impacting the geoenvironment adversely.

Based on experiences from the Baltic Sea and existing practices from countries with different management systems clear distinction between the management of natural and anthropogenic components of cast material is seen as an essential prerequisite for developing sustainable product chains that allow beach wrack to be used as a resource of commercial value. Presenting and discussing examples from Denmark (Køge Municipality), Germany (Kühlungsborn, Rügen and Poel Island), Poland (Gulf of Gdansk), Russia (Curonian and Vistula spits) and Sweden (Kalmar municipality and Öland), social, ecological, and economic consequences of beach wrack removal are analysed to improve the attractiveness of beaches for recreational purposes. It also includes potential contribution to Baltic Sea water restoration processes through the removal of the organic part of beach cast, where indeed more studies about the chemical (nutrients, metals) composition of beach wrack are required for reliable calculation of a depuration rate. For local economies within the Baltic Sea region, the organic part of beach cast (beach wrack and terrestrial debris) has reasonable economic prospects as a renewable natural resource, e.g. for soil improvement products, in fertilisers and bio-coal production, for landfill covers (contributing to climate change mitigation), biogas generation, and even for coastal protection by providing humus-like material for accelerated dune vegetation succession. For all these recycling options the development of cost-efficient technologies for collecting beach cast on sandy as well as stony beaches and also for separating the organic part from sand and anthropogenic litter (mainly plastic), is urgently required. Amendments of legal regulations, that better reflect the dualism of beach cast are also required. In essence, dualism results from the fact that beach wrack is a part of nature (or a natural resource) when it remains on a beach. However, beach wrack immediately becomes legally categorised as waste once humans collect it irrespective of its litter content. Another legal aspect being dealt with originates from the migration of the beach wrack between water and beach, whilst it is an object of ерleagl cleaning operations only at the beach it onto the beach, but not whilst in the water. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Baltic Sea; Beach cast; Beach wrack; Management; Socio-economic value","Climate change; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Economics; Land fill; Laws and legislation; Seawater; Shore protection; Soils; Anthropogenic components; Cleaning operations; Climate change mitigation; Coastal protection; Economic consequences; Economically viable; Sustainable products; Vegetation successions; Beaches","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85096917544",NA,NA

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA  02215, United States","Centuries of human activities, particularly housing and transportation practices from the late 19th century through the 1980's, dispersed hundreds of millions of tons of lead into our urban areas. The urban lead burden is evident among humans, wild and domesticated animals, and plants. Animal lead exposures closely mirror and often exceed the lead exposure patterns of their human partners. Some examples: Pigeons in New York City neighborhoods mimicked the lead exposures of neighborhood children, with more contaminated areas associated with higher exposures in both species. Also, immediately following the lead in drinking water crisis in Flint MI in 2015, blood lead levels in pet dogs in Flint were 4 times higher than in surrounding towns. And combining lead's neurotoxicity with urban stress results in well-characterized aggressive behaviors across multiple species. Lead pollution is not distributed evenly across urban areas. Although average US pediatric lead exposures have declined by 90% since the 1970s, there remain well defined neighborhoods where children continue to have toxic lead exposures; animals are poisoned there, too. Those neighborhoods tend to have disproportionate commercial and industrial lead activity; a history of dense traffic; older and deteriorating housing; past and operating landfills, dumps and hazardous waste sites; and often lead contaminated drinking water. The population there tends to be low income and minority. Urban wild and domesticated animals bear that same lead burden. Soil, buildings, dust and even trees constitute huge lead repositories throughout urban areas. Until and unless we begin to address the lead repositories in our cities, the urban lead burden will continue to impose enormous costs distributed disproportionately across the domains of the natural environment. Evidence-based research has shown the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of some US public policies to prevent or reduce these exposures. We end with a series of recommendations to manage lead-safe urban environments. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Environmental justice; Lead; One health; Urban environmental policy; Urban exposures","copper; drinking water; gasoline; lead; tetraethyllead; drinking water; hazardous waste; landfill; lead; neighborhood; pollution exposure; spatiotemporal analysis; toxicity; urban area; atmospheric deposition; bear; climate change; cost effectiveness analysis; domestic animal; environmental policy; environmental protection; evidence based practice; housing; human; lowest income group; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; One Health; priority journal; public policy; residential area; Review; runoff; suburban population; surface property; urban area; water contamination; Flint; Michigan; New York [New York (STT)]; United States; Columba","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85098709250",NA,NA

The N supply must maximize yield while minimizing environmental impact. In response to the above problems, we evaluated different approaches to nitrogen fertilizer management based on grain yield, economic benefits and environmental benefits of spring maize systems from 2017 to 2019 in a semiarid area of northwestern China. The four treatments included solid granular urea with a split application (UR), one-time application of a mixture of controlled release and solid granular urea (CU), straw return with the combination of controlled release and solid granular urea (CUS) and control (CK). From the perspective of agricultural production, compared with the CK, high yields (&gt;15 Mg ha−1) were guaranteed in the other treatments. Considering both the environment and the economy, compared with the UR treatment, the CU treatment not only improved the economic efficiency of maize cultivation (increased by 4.9%–12.1%) but also significantly decreased the net global warming potential (NGWP) and carbon footprint (CF) (decreased by 21.1–21.7% and 17.8–23.1%, respectively). At the same time, the CU treatment optimized the proportions of N2O emissions at different growth stages and reduced the risk of emissions caused by high temperatures and rainfall in the middle and late stages of maize growth. Compared to the CU treatment, although the CUS treatment increased CO2 and N2O emissions (increased by 35% and 51%, respectively), the accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) was enhanced by straw return, which offset the negative impact of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and significantly reduced the NGWP and CF compared to values for the other three treatments (decreased by 51% and 50%, respectively). With a comprehensive consideration of environmental impacts and economic benefits, the combination of solid granular urea (SGU) and controlled release urea (CRU) with the straw return is an environmentally friendly, high-yielding, high-economic benefit and low-emissions production technology for arid and semiarid areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Controlled release urea; Greenhouse gases; Net global warming potential; Straw return","Agricultural robots; Carbon footprint; Cultivation; Economics; Emission control; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Global warming; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse gases; Metabolism; Mixtures; Nitrogen fertilizers; Organic carbon; Soil pollution; Springs (components); Urea; Agricultural productions; Arid and semi-arid areas; Different growth stages; Environmental benefits; Fertilizer management; Global warming potential; Plastic film mulching; Production technology; Economic and social effects","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85092030007",NA,NA

The potential health effects of fire ash on farmworkers in orchards via inhalation exposure after fire is rarely studied. After the 2017 Thomas Fire, in Ventura County (California, USA), fire ash and corresponding soil samples were collected from several impacted orchards and analyzed for eight trace elements (TEs) and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Results indicate that except for mercury (Hg), the concentrations of TEs and PAHs were higher in ash samples compared with the corresponding soil samples. In general, ash samples showed greater potential to expose farmworkers to health risks than the corresponding soil samples. One site had particularly high concentrations of As (778 mg kg−1), Cr (629 mg kg−1), and Cu (499 mg kg−1) in the ash. This location corresponds to a house which was burned during the Thomas Fire, which might have contained chromated copper arsenate as a wood preservative. Therefore, the existence of construction materials in orchards could add hazardous materials to ash deposited on soil. Furthermore, a monitored dust generation experiment was designed to obtain the particle emission factors (PEF) of soil and ash, which is an essential parameter for the calculation of inhalation health risks. A two-fold difference in the PEFs was found between ash and the corresponding soil sample. Hence, health risks through inhalation exposure from fire ash may be underestimated if the default PEF suggested by the US Environmental Protection Agency is used. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Arsenic; Chromium; Particle emission factor; Risk assessment; Trace elements; Wildfire","acenaphthene; acenaphthylene; anthracene; arsenic; arsenic acid; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[ghi]perylene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; benz[a]anthracene; cadmium; chromium; chrysene; copper; dibenz[a,h]anthracene; fluoranthene; fluorene; indeno[1,2,3 cd]pyrene; lead; mercury; naphthalene; nickel; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; wood protecting agent; zinc; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; trace element; agricultural worker; arsenate; chemical composition; chromate; concentration (composition); copper; dust; experimental study; pollution exposure; soil chemistry; wildfire; agricultural worker; Article; ash; California; chemical composition; dangerous goods; dust; environmental protection; fire; health hazard; inhalation; orchard; risk assessment; soil; soil analysis; wildfire; agricultural worker; environmental monitoring; human; soil; soil pollutant; California; United States; Ventura County; California; Environmental Monitoring; Farmers; Fires; Humans; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trace Elements","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85094572795",NA,NA

Therefore, indicators for measuring the different levels of a CE (micro, meso, and macro) should be a high priority for stakeholders (governments, companies, NGOs, civil society, etc.) in order to track progress on CE initiatives. However, the increasing interest on CE has caused a still open debate on the conceptualization of CE which hampers the creation of indicators based on a common conceptual framework. As a result, the absence of standard indicators to track progress on circularity is leading to contradiction and misunderstanding, which represents a challenge to the implementation of CE strategies. Thus, this study tries to address this gap by advancing a set of indicators adapted from existing indicators that guarantees simplicity and effectiveness, closely based on indicators proposed by government bodies. This research carried out an exploratory study to formulate the indicators requirements based on literature, refined through experts’ opinion and then they were tested in Spanish companies located in the Basque Country region through an empirical work to assess this theory. A mix of research methods (e.g. semi-structured interviews and surveys) were used to seek applicability of CE indicators for organisations. The study showed that the proposed indicators currently used for assessing the CE at the macro level were applicable at the micro level based on companies’ responses. This fact demonstrated that the indicators serve the purpose of being applicable to companies regardless of the type of economic activity they were in. Also, it shows that indicators used to monitor progress on CE at the macro level can be translated to the micro level. Consequently, it is recommended that the set of CE indicators focused on the methodology proposed in this study should be used across different industrial sectors in order to observe performance in companies to facilitate the transition to a CE model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment; Circular economy; Indicators; Micro level; Performance","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Circular economy; Conceptual frameworks; Economic activities; Exploratory studies; Industrial sector; ITS applications; Semi structured interviews; Track progress; Economics","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85089744621",NA,NA

Eduardo Cabello 6, Vigo, 36208, Spain","Global production of shell calcium carbonate (CaCO3) from bivalve aquaculture amounts about 13.6 million metric tons per year. Shells, traditionally considered a waste of aquaculture activities, have recently acquired an interest under the current framework of zero waste circular economy. Shell CaCO3 is a sustainable biomaterial that could partly replace the presently dominating non-renewable mineral sources in some applications. Although the carbon footprint of powdered CaCO3 production from biological or mineral sources are about the same, the environmental impact is notably different. Furthermore, bivalve CaCO3 contributes to sequester anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) during shell formation, although this is still controversial. Anyway, the integration of bivalve aquaculture in the carbon trading market would demand that shell CaCO3 is employed in activities that sequester their CO2 for prolonged time periods. Ideally, these activities should combine 1) providing the maximum added value to the biomaterial; 2) producing the lowest carbon footprint during their life cycle; and 3) preserving the CaCO3 integrity as long as possible. In this review, we analyse the effect of bivalve consume habits, particularly mussel, on the availability of shells and their possible agricultural, industrial, and environmental engineering applications from these multiple perspectives. Furthermore, global, continental and regional demands of CaCO3 are matched with their respective mussel aquaculture productions in an effort to scale up offer and demand. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bivalve shells; Carbon footprint; Carbon trading market; Inertization time; Renewable calcium carbonate","Agricultural robots; Aquaculture; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Mineral industry; Molluscs; Shells (structures); Added values; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Carbon trading; Circular economy; Global production; Non-renewable; Shell formation; Time-periods; Carbon footprint","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85089938154",NA,NA

High-throughput sequencing of community was applied to soils receiving annual applications of an alkaline stabilized biosolid (ATB), at four increasing rates over 10 years, as an environmental stressor in contrast to a one-time application of ATB ten years prior. Bacterial community structure was more greatly influenced by annual ATB applications relative to fungi and eukaryotes. Specifically, higher relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi were measured in annual ATB rates relative to the single ATB rates and the control. High rates of annual ATB applications resulted in lower bacterial alpha-diversity, as well as fungal and eukaryotic Shannon diversity, but single ATB or lower rates of ATB applied annually showed increased alpha -diversity relative to the control. Soil microbiome responses to annual ATB and single ATB rates were also examined using co-occurrence network analysis. High rates and frequency of ATB application resulted in a decrease in network interactions, lower average number of neighbors, and reduced network density compared to control soils. A concomitant increase in network diameter and characteristic path length further suggests annual additions of ATB led to a more adapted, but less cooperative, state in the microbiome. The data suggest a more universal functional response of microbiomes to the stressors compared to community structure and local diversity. In particular, beta-analysis and network analysis were both able to resolve significant effects on soil microbiomes 10 years post-application of low rates of ATB. Community complexity and stability were increased by single low rate of ATB additions and decreased by single high rate and annual moderate rates of ATB additions. These results provide insights into the effects that ATB additions have on soil community after only one-time use and after annual additions over a decade. © 2020 The Authors","Biosolids; Microbial cooperation; Microbiome stability; Network topology; Soil memory","Agricultural robots; Biosolids; Bacterial community structure; Characteristic path lengths; Co-occurrence networks; Community structures; Environmental stressors; High-throughput sequencing; Microbial community structures; Stabilized biosolids; Soils; agricultural soil; alkaline rock; annual variation; biosolid; community structure; microbial community; organic matter; soil microorganism; Acidobacteria; article; Bacteroidetes; biosolid; Chloroflexi; community structure; controlled study; eukaryote; human; memory; microbiome; nonhuman; Proteobacteria; soil; microbial consortium; microbiology; microflora; Acidobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Eukaryota; Fungi; Proteobacteria; Biosolids; Microbial Consortia; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85090004990",NA,NA

However, the level of environmental sustainability of CE strategies could be improved and this topic deserves more attention by the scientific community. This research addresses this gap and aims at presenting a new concept, named circular ecology (CEL), and its application to the field of waste management. (2) Methods: The paper presents a literature review on the criticalities of CE and on examples of studies that implement the CEL principles. (3) Results: The review highlights that CEL principles are widely applied to several fields of waste management, showing promising opportunities to export the results to other geographical contexts.

The aim of the study was to investigate their properties as components of wood-plastic composites and to investigate the properties of the wood-plastic composites produced. The overall objective was to test the potential of available alien plant species as raw material for the manufacture of products. This would contribute to sustainability and give them a better chance of ending their life cycle. One of the possible solutions on a large scale is to use alien wood species for the production of wood plastic composites (WPC). Five invasive alien hardwood species have been used in combination with polyethylene powder (PE) and maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (MAPE) to produce various flat pressed WPC boards. Microstructural analyses (confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) and mechanical tests (flexural strength, tensile strength) were performed. Furthermore, measurements of density, thickness swelling, water absorption and dimensional stability during heating and cooling were carried out. Comparisons were made between the properties of six WPC boards (five alien wood species and mixed boards). The results showed that the differences between different invasive alien wood species were less obvious in mechanical properties, while the differences in sorption properties and dimensional stability were more significant. The analyses of the WPC structure showed a good penetration of the polymer into the lumens of the wood cells and a fine internal structure without voids. These are crucial conditions to obtain a good, mechanically strong and water-resistant material. © 2020 by the authors.

Tracer-based-sorting (TBS) is an innovative identification technology based on fluorescent tracers and a corresponding detection unit. TBS can be considered a radical technology change towards a circular economy for plastics and to support sustainability as it has the potential to render several established sorting and/or recycling steps obsolete. This article shows which drivers and barriers are perceived by stakeholders with regard to the implementation of TBS in the market and how challenges are addressed responsibly in the early phases of the innovation process. Influencing external factors and framework conditions of TBS are identified and suitable business models for TBS in a circular economy are discussed. Further, practical recommendations on how to optimize technology and market development for TBS are provided. To obtain these results a mixed method approach of integrated innovation and sustainability analysis, external environment analysis (PESTEL analysis), and business model development approaches was chosen. The research results can be understood as a practical contribution towards a responsible and sustainable implementation of a radical technology-based innovation for a circular economy of plastics. © 2020 by the authors.

Although research on plastic ingestion by seabirds is increasing, few studies have examined policies and long-term monitoring programs to reduce marine plastic in the Arctic. This paper provides a review of international, national, and regional policies and long-term monitoring programs that address marine plastic in relation to seabirds in the Arctic countries: Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark (Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United States of America. Results show that a broad range of international, national, regional and local policies address marine debris, specifically through waste management and the prevention of pollution from ships. However, few policies directly address seabirds and other marine biota. Further, policies are implemented inconsistently across regions, making it difficult to enforce and monitor the efficacy of these policies given the long-range transport of plastic pollution globally. To reduce marine plastic pollution in the Arctic environment, pan-Arctic and international collaboration is needed to implement standardized policies and long-term monitoring programs for marine plastic in the Arctic and worldwide.

One way coastal communities respond to this challenge is through the environmental stewardship practice of volunteer beach cleanups. Beyond providing temporarily cleaner local beaches, how might these beach cleanups have broader impacts in the global struggle against plastic pollution? Using the lenses of environmental stewardship and civic ecology, we conducted a content analysis of primary source materials created by 50 groups involved in volunteer beach cleanups. We collected data on the scale at which groups coordinate volunteer beach cleanups, the roles they play in conducting these cleanups, how they interact with other volunteer beach cleanup groups, and the other forms of stewardship they conduct, if any. Within our sample, we identified groups coordinating volunteer beach cleanups at five geographic scales: local, sub-national, national, multi-national, and global. Within the groups operating at each scale, we found groups conducting environmental stewardship in the forms of education, advocacy, research, and monitoring in addition to their conservation work through beach cleanups. Our findings demonstrate that groups branch out their impacts by combining different forms of environmental stewardship targeting plastic pollution, and they collaborate to scale up their actions in ways that contribute to plastic pollution governance. Connecting these findings with the literature on the broader impacts of civic ecology practices allows us to theorize how volunteer beach cleanup groups branch out and scale up their efforts to weave a global net of ocean stewardship. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Beach cleans; Civic ecology; Marine litter; Ocean stewardship","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85089457368",NA,NA

Data from China’s Huainan mining area were collected through a questionnaire survey and statistically analyzed through a structural equation model and a resistance diagnosis. Results showed that the relative importance of behavior perception (0.457), behavior attitude (0.332), and behavior norms (0.231) to the mining area ecological protection decreases successively for mining area residents. Further, the dominant influencing factors of economic benefits and neighborhood ethic pressure are identical, except for the observed variables of behavior perception, and there is a difference between the second and the third observed variables in relation to behavior attitude. Finally, it was also found that the causal chain path coefficient of groups with no willingness to pay was greater than that of the others. The findings of this study can help understand the impacts between the behavior cognition of mining area ecological protection and ecological protection, as well as the impact of mining area resident behavior willingness on the causal chain. Further, ecological protection knowledge production based on these are beneficial to achieve ecological security and sustainable development of mining areas.

Blockchain technology has been suggested as one possible critical solution to overcome the current barriers of implementing the circular economy concept. This article addresses the nascent research field of blockchain for a circular economy and examines current developments, from both research and practice. By developing and conducting a research-practice gap analysis using a systematic literature review, this article identifies patterns of interests and opportunities for research and practice and uncovers mutual blind spots that need to be addressed in either sphere. A systematic literature review and qualitative analysis covering 57 diverse documents (journal articles, contents linked from twitter, and google results) revealed three key findings: 1) a clear terminology of blockchain types, their technical properties and benefits are lacking in research, 2) trust and verification are major potential benefits but a challenge to create, and 3) a closer examination of possible benefits and challenges of blockchain technologies for the circular economy with its links to sustainable development is crucial. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","blockchain; circular economy; research-practice gap; supply chain management; sustainability; systematic literature review","Blockchain; Planning; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Critical solution; Economic activities; Journal articles; Potential benefits; Qualitative analysis; Systematic literature review; Technical properties; Economics","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85098083992",NA,NA

Preceding qualitative WEFN studies largely neglected the role of local stakeholder participation, which could only reflect fragments of the systems. Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) have been proven to be effective for supporting stakeholder participation in many other areas. Nevertheless, there was a lack of impartial methods that could make CLD analysis tractable without significantly impairing the WEFN systems integrity. To fill such gaps, a novel method based on merging and reduction rules was proposed to reasonably merge and downscale WEFN CLDs built by stakeholders. Based on this improved method, a CLD-based methodology was developed as a prototype for characterizing WEFN systems, prescribing the WEFN problem, exploring its causes and consequences, and identifying effective measures and policies for alleviating conflicts. To validate the applicability of the developed methodology, it was applied to a real case. The results indicated that total water consumption, water allocation among varied sectors, available surface water, and available groundwater, as well as indirect factors such as volume of diverted water and agricultural water consumption, were the keys to alleviate water scarcity problem under WEFN in the study area. Measures and polices focusing on the interactions between surface water and groundwater could be viable for alleviating the problem.

One strategy for circular cities is to reintroduce manufacturing into urban areas (or “urban manufacturing”), allowing resource flows to be localized at the city scale. However, the extent to which urban manufacturing contributes to circular cities is unclear in existing literature. The purpose of this paper is therefore twofold: to understand whether urban manufacturing could contribute to the circular economy, and to understand the drivers and barriers to circular urban manufacturing. By reviewing existing literature and interviewing experts, we identified the caveats for the contribution of urban manufacturing to circular cities, as well as the spatial, social, and material-related drivers and barriers for circular urban manufacturing. © 2020 by the authors.

With limited space and degraded resources in coastal areas, offshore waters will be a particular focus of Blue Economy expansion over the next decade. When emerging and established economic sectors expand in offshore waters (within national Exclusive Economic Zones), different potential Blue Economy opportunities and challenges will arise. Following a series of interdisciplinary workshops, we imagine two technically possible futures for the offshore Blue Economy and we identify the actions required to achieve the more sustainable outcome. Under a business as usual scenario the focus will remain on economic growth, the commodification of nature, the dominance of private over public and cultural interests, and prioritisation of the interests of current over future generations. A more sustainable scenario would meet multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals and ensure inclusive economic developments, environmental sustainability, and fair and equitable access to resources and technologies across users, nations, and generations. Challenges to this more sustainable future are a lack of infrastructure and technology to support emerging offshore sectors, limited understanding of environmental impacts, inequitable outcomes, and a lack of planning and governmental oversight. Addressing these challenges will require a shift in societal values, a more balanced allocation of funding to offshore activities, transparency in information sharing between industries and across nations, and adjustment of international legal and institutional mechanisms. The sustainable and equitable offshore Blue Economy we envisage is achievable and provides a unique opportunity to build global capacity and partnership.

Whether other physiological or developmental aspects change as stands age, and how those aspects may impact long-term stand dynamics, remains unclear. Conventional experimental designs study a single stand over multiple growing seasons and thereby confound age-related changes with growing season conditions. Here we used a staggered-start experimental design with three repeated planting years over two growing seasons to isolate growing season effects. We studied changes in Miscanthus × giganteus phenology during its yield-building stage (first 3 years) and estimated age, growing season and nitrogen (N) effects on development using nonlinear regression parameters. Stand age clearly changed plant growth; faster developmental rates were usually seen in 1-year-old stands (young), but because 2- and 3-year-old stands (mature) emerged 3 months earlier than newly planted stands they produced (Formula presented.) 30% more stems with 30%–60% more leaves. Nitrogen fertilization modulated some age-related phenological changes. Fertilized 2-year-old stands reached similar stem densities as unfertilized 3-year-old stands and had fewer number of senesced leaves like 1-year-old stands. In addition, N fertilization had no effect on young M. × giganteus, but extended mature stands’ growing season more than 2 weeks by hastening emergence and delaying senescence. It also delayed flowering regardless of stand age. Our results suggest that, along with changes in size, M. × giganteus stands showed shifts in developmental strategies: young stands emerged later and developed faster, while mature stands grew for longer but more slowly. In temperate regions, where hard frost events are likely to interrupt development in late autumn, rapid early development is critical to plant survival. Nonlinear regression parameter differences proved effective in identifying phenological shifts. © 2020 The Authors.

This study analyzes the three carbon offsetting programs (the Clean Development Mechanism, the Verified Carbon Standard and the Gold Standard) with the largest market shares by systematically comparing their standard documents with environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) standards (ISO 14067 and ISO 14040/44). The programs’ most important methodologies are assigned to the sectors forestry, renewable energy, energy efficiency, industrial gas, and waste. We analyzed each sector for its compatibility with LCA using a criteria evaluation scheme to answer the main question, whether the methodologies provide guidance on life cycle emission accounting and what uncertainties they face. The offsetting standards differ from LCA standards due to different analyzed systems, system boundaries and purposes of their methods. Furthermore, offsetting methods always apply scenario analysis. Environmental impacts apart from greenhouse gases are not quantified, rather environmental impact assessments of heterogeneous quality are applied. We find that the approaches in the analyzed carbon offsets are incompatible with the LCA approach, mainly because they always involve scenario analysis, do not include all life-cycle phases and do not account for additional (negative) environmental and social impacts that project activities related to carbon offsets may cause. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon offsets; Climate change; Climate protection projects; Emission trading; Environmental accounting; LCA; Sustainable development","","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85091574766",NA,NA

Here we describe how varying the biofuel demand could help address these concerns. Variable biofuel demand can be implemented through market or policy mechanisms that adjust biofuel production according to feedstock availability, expanding or contracting in response to supply surplus or limitations. Based on a survey, an expert workshop, and relevant literature, the effects of a variable biofuel demand approach are evaluated with respect to food security, agricultural productivity, detrimental land-use change, and feedstock competition with biobased chemicals and materials. Here we provide evidence that variable biofuel demand can enhance the synergistic development of agriculture, renewable biomass feedstocks and biofuels, but implementation faces several challenges.

However, limited biomass availability can halt the expansion of bio-based sectors, unless alternative raw materials are employed and cascading uses are implemented on a large scale. Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) can contribute to feedstock diversification and improved biomass conversion efficiencies along supply chains, although concerns arise about their actual viability and competitiveness. A systematic review of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and related process-based approaches is carried out to evaluate the sustainability of advanced bio-based technologies, defined as those that use either non-food feedstock or circularity principles –or both– for delivering diverse products. A classification scheme is proposed to categorise KETs based on the feedstock employed (plant residues and perennials, designer crops, algae, or biological waste) or the underlying technological configuration (enzyme/microbial assisted processing or biorefineries). Results show that producing biofuels and biochemicals from perennial plants, lignocellulosic residues and algae has advantages in terms of greenhouse gas emissions relative to their fossil counterparts, while trade-offs occur with other environmental impacts and sustainability dimensions. Cradle-to-cradle systems can deliver additional sustainability gains, but their implementation poses technical and socio-political challenges. Further harmonisation of LCA methodologies is desirable to compare KETs in different sectoral, geographical and policy contexts.

Redundancy analysis revealed that soil physical (soil bulk density and water content), chemical (soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), and biological (soil enzymatic activity and nutrient content) characteristics affect the soil bacterial community. Changed soil quality indices may be favorable for leaf photo-assimilate accumulation. Compared with RTNM treatment, GMNM and GMMF treatments significantly increased photosynthesis rate in the peanut leaf and decreased intercellular carbon dioxide concentration. Our results showed that compared with that after RTNM treatment, the average pod yield after GMMF and GMNM treatments increased by 27.85 and 21.26%, respectively, due to increases in the pods per plant and plant numbers. The highest yield of all treatments was obtained from the GMMF-treated plot, followed by that from the GMNM-treated plots. Thus, taking into consideration the residual pollution caused by plastic films, we propose GMNM as a suitable strategy to improve soil physicochemical and microbial properties and to increase the peanut pod yield. © Copyright © 2020 Yang, Liu, Wang, Gao, Zhao, Li and Li.","bacterial diversity; green manure; mulching film; peanut; soil health; tillage; yield","carbon dioxide; green manure; RNA 16S; Article; biomass; bulk density; cropping system; DNA extraction; effect size; enzyme activity; green manure with no mulching; harvest; illumina sequencing; microbial community; mulch; nonhuman; nutrient uptake; peanut; photosynthesis; physical chemistry; plant growth; polymerase chain reaction; porosity; rotary tillage with no mulching; soil management; soil water content; species richness; tillage; water content","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85099044852",NA,NA

Objective: Analyzing why and how to scale up the metabolic study from city to country. Methods: Combining quantitative analysis with a literature review socio-metabolic research, since it is an effective method to study resource and environmental issues and has been applied at different scales. Results: 1) A single city or a smaller area is hardly self-sufficient, and its sustainability and resilience needs the support of the surrounding environment; 2) At the country scale, systems exhibit a higher level of self-organization and a corresponding higher level of complexity, addressing the need for applying the metabolic theory at the national scale; 3) The emergy analysis methods show its advantages in study metabolic processes for national metabolism; 4) Input-output analysis plays an important role in and region coordination. Conclusions: The interactions among and within the scales are nested, as well as the goals and methods. Therefore, socio-metabolic research on scales differ in their priority goals, and the methods adopted must be targeted. © 2020 The Author(s).

Although existing studies have mainly focused on the efficiency of technologies for removing pollutants in wastewater, efforts to intensify the overall performance of CWs have not been reported. Here, we propose a novel theoretical scheme for promoting optimal overall performance of CWs through the development of an integrated approach, entailing simulation, evaluation, and optimization strategies for their management. We successfully simulated the water distribution system of the Yanfangdian CW in Beijing, China, applying 42 hydrological parameters within the MIKE 21 software. We further evaluated our simulation results by performing an analytic hierarchy process to calculate performance scores. The back propagation neural network was well trained to quantify the relationship between the hydrological parameters and the overall performance of CW based on its water distribution characteristics and their corresponding scores. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm was applied to determine the hydrological solution. A strategy for optimizing the water level and flow was formulated for improving the ecological, purification and storage performances of the targeted CW along with a flexible strategy for ensuring its proper functioning. Our approach provides a robust and universal platform that can contribute significantly to the advancement of CWs that have a wide range of applications and could be extended to other ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Artificial neural networks; Genetic algorithm; MIKE 21; Water quality","Backpropagation; Ecosystems; Genetic algorithms; Integrated control; Water distribution systems; Water levels; Back propagation neural networks; Constructed wetlands; Constructed wetlands (CWs); Ecological environments; Flexible strategies; Hydrological parameters; Integrated approach; Optimization strategy; Wetlands; water; algorithm; artificial neural network; constructed wetland; integrated approach; pollutant removal; urban area; urban ecosystem; wastewater; wastewater treatment; Article; back propagation neural network; calculation; China; constructed wetland; genetic algorithm; hydrological model; priority journal; urban area; water supply; Beijing [China]; China","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85091352033",NA,NA

Its relationship with environmental factors is an issue that has attracted the attention of scientists and governments. This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of “one health” approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in future epidemic threats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Environment; Environmental impacts; One health; Pollutants; SARS-CoV-2","Disease control; Diseases; Ecosystems; Health risks; Pollution; Viruses; Cause-effect relationships; Climatic factors; Ecosystem services; Environmental factors; Immunological response; Infectious disease; Particulate Matter; Smart technology; Environmental management; air quality; COVID-19; disease control; disease spread; disease transmission; environmental conditions; environmental management; epidemic; future prospect; pollution effect; public health; respiratory disease; viral disease; air pollution; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental management; human; liquid waste; nonhuman; particulate matter; pollutant; priority journal; solid waste; wildlife; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; ecosystem; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85089171866",NA,NA

Besides, considering the assessment sensibility affected of different LCA methodologies, totally 13 methods were used to form a comprehensive assessment result. The ecological footprint of the Li–S, sodium-ion and Li-air batteries are 189.40 Pt, 182.58 Pt and 29.84 Pt, respectively; the carbon footprint of the Li–S, sodium-ion and Li-air batteries are 67.94 kg CO2eq, 64.35 kg CO2eq and 10.15 kg CO2eq, respectively; and the water footprint of the Li–S, sodium-ion and Li-air batteries are 151.11 m3, 316.42 m3 and 21.15 m3, respectively.

Also providing 1 kWh of electricity, far low demand for lithium resource is the main reason for Li-air battery to show its environmental advantages compared with Li–S battery. Besides, the close ecological and carbon footprints of sodium-ion battery are close to that of Li–S battery. And there is a far large water footprint of sodium-ion battery compared with Li–S battery. The low cost advantage of sodium resources is not enough to be reflected in the sodium-ion battery's environmental advantages.

The major sources of MPs are terrestrial and agricultural lands. But their fate, concentration in the terrestrial environment, and effects on soil and biota are poorly understood. There is a growing body of concern about the adverse effects of MPs on soil-dwelling organisms such as microbes in mycorrhizae and earthworms that mediate essential ecosystem services. Environmental concentrations and effects of MPs are considered to increase with increasing trend of its global production. MPs in the soil could directly impact plants through blocking the seed pore, limiting the uptake of water and nutrient through roots, aggregation, and accumulation in the root, shoot, and leaves. However, MPs can also indirectly impact plants by affecting soil physicochemical characteristics, soil-dwelling microbes, and fauna. An affected soil could impact plant community structure and perhaps primary production. In this article, we have assessed the potential direct and indirect impacts of MPs on plants. We have discussed both the positive and negative impacts of MPs on plants in terrestrial systems based on currently available limited literature on this topic and our hypothetical understandings.

Interactions of plastics with natural particles are also largely understudied across all ecosystems but are becoming the focus of an emerging field on plastic cycling. Some studies have investigated short-term interactions, and some models predict short turnover times at the sediment surface on open shorelines. However, buried plastics may be retained longer in wetlands where accretion is often high, and some studies suggest their use as historical markers. The ubiquity, persistence, and behavior of plastic particles within wetlands warrants their consideration as novel sedimentary particles. Viewing plastics in this context will allow land managers to better predict how these vulnerable systems respond to increasing inputs of plastic pollution.

The determination of suitable end of life (EoL) strategies furthers this aim. Notably, the socio-economic aspects of EoL alternatives associated with bio-based products have been neglected. This paper contributes to filling this gap by proposing a new socio-economic indicator for EoL (SEI-EoL). The SEI-EoL is developed from an integrated analytic hierarchy process–multicriteria decision analysis (AHP-MCDA) model based on experts' involvement, and is capable of measuring and comparing the socio-economic performance of EoL alternatives for bio-based products. The SEI-EoL is applied to the specific case of polylactic acid (PLA)–based film for food packaging. The results indicate that value chain actors are the most influential category of stakeholders in EoL management, and the assessment of criteria shows that waste disposal cost, resource efficiency and EoL responsibility play a key role in this management. The highest value EoL strategy for PLA-based film for food packaging is mechanical recycling, followed by chemical recycling. Circularity assessment, policy maker responsibility and incentives for recycled materials/green processes represent the most relevant items to consider for policy recommendations and actions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-based products; Economic criteria; End of life; Multicriteria analysis; Social criteria","analytical hierarchy process; policy making; recycling; socioeconomic indicator; strategic approach; sustainability","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85089489093",NA,NA

High annual rainfall in monsoonal regions makes rainwater harvesting an attractive alternative, but lack of infrastructure for capturing and storing sufficient quantities is often restrictive. This study focuses on the coastal region of Bangladesh where groundwater supplying tubewells are progressively found to contain arsenic and high salinity, and where cyclones are a common cause of damage to infrastructure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of a village scale rainwater harvesting scheme as a solution to water security concerns. Analysis of various size rainwater storage systems (RSS) is conducted using daily rainfall data from Khulna Station in Bangladesh. It was found that a village scale RSS with 3 m deep and 100 m by 100 m surface area could supply 100 L/p/d for 85% of the year. The reliability could feasibly be increased to 100% with seasonal water restrictions. The village scale RSS is compared with an individual household level RSS. Advantages of the village scale RSS include the opportunity for improved management and water quality monitoring, and the potential for public-private partnerships. The proposed methodology can be adapted to other monsoonal delta regions to enhance water supply. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Bangladesh; Drinking water; Rainwater harvesting; Village scale schemes; Water supply","Digital storage; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Harvesting; Potable water; Rain; Storms; Water quality; Water supply; Analysis of various; Annual rainfall; Coastal regions; Public private partnerships; Rain water harvesting; Remote communities; Water quality monitoring; Water restrictions; Rural areas; drinking water; feasibility study; groundwater resource; public-private partnership; rainwater; rural area; sustainability; village; water resource; water supply; Bangladesh; Khulna [Bangladesh]","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85092380745",NA,NA

Based on an analysis of 59 research articles, we find that despite a growing number of social sciences studies on the forest-based bioeconomy, much of the research tends to replicate a bioeconomy imaginary articulated in EU and national bioeconomy policies and strategies. Accordingly, the research primarily reproduces a weak approach to sustainability, which prioritize economic growth and competitiveness. Expectations are largely directed at national and regional corporate interests and forest industrial renewal, while the state has a supportive rather than restricting role. We discuss the findings against the role of social sciences, and conclude that social science scholars may adopt various strategies if interested in opening up forest-based policy debates and offer alternative imaginaries of sustainable bioeconomy transformations. © 2020, The Author(s).","Circular bioeconomy; Equity; Forest-based bioeconomy; Knowledge-based economy; Sustainability transitions; Sustainable transformation","economic conditions; economic growth; European Union; literature review; strategic approach; sustainability; biotechnology; economic development; forest; industry; policy; Biotechnology; Economic Development; Forests; Industry; Policy","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85092346168",NA,NA

Thrown on the soil surface, they can remain unchanged for years, poisoning surrounding ecosystems with toxins accumulated during the smoking process. However, there is practically no data on the effect of smoked CBs on soil biota or soil animals in particular, nor on the potential of edaphic fauna to facilitate their decomposition. One of the most promising agents among soil animals are earthworms, which are known to be beneficial in the processes of recalcitrant organic matter degradation and stimulation of microbial activity in detrital food webs. In a microcosm experiment with the sod podzolic soil, we aimed at testing the effect of the commonly cultured epigeic earthworm Eisenia fetida (Savigny 1826) on the biodegradation rate of CBs and the possible adverse effects of this waste on the species. The experiment had a full-factorial design with three categorical predictors: CB number (0, 1 and 3 per microcosm); smoking condition (smoked and unsmoked CBs) and two levels of earthworm amendment (0 and 4 per microcosm). During 70 days of the experiment, we did not observe any smoked CB-induced mortality of earthworms. The addition of E. fetida significantly increased the CB mass loss across all treatment combinations. Specifically, earthworms improved the decomposition rate from 30 to 36% (p &lt; 0.05), on average. However, this improvement was mainly associated with CB paper wrapping consumption. The inhibition of CO2 emission in microcosms with CBs and earthworms suggested the direct consumption of this waste by E. fetida, rather than modulation of the degradation potential of a microbial community. E. fetida appears to thus be a moderately promising agent for CB biodegradation with the simultaneous reduction in carbon loss from soil through the microbial channel in the studied soil type. These results open perspectives for the further evaluation of the role of soil macroinvertebrates in recalcitrant organic waste management in general and CBs in particular. We demonstrated that earthworms can efficiently decompose smoked and unsmoked cigarette butts regardless of their toxic potential and simultaneously reduce associated microbial activity. © 2020","Biodegradation; CO2 emission; Ecotoxicology; Lumbricidae; Soil contamination with polymers; Soil fauna","Animals; Biodegradation; Ecology; Electric circuit breakers; Smoke; Soils; Tobacco; Waste management; Degradation potential; Full factorial design; Microbial communities; Microcosm experiments; Recalcitrant organic matter; Simultaneous reduction; Soil macroinvertebrates; Treatment combinations; Soil testing; decomposition; earthworm; food web; microbial activity; microbial community; Podzol; soil biota; soil ecosystem; soil organic matter; soil surface; Animalia; Eisenia fetida; Lumbricidae","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85091954616",NA,NA

Solutions thus require changes to or cessation of those activities in addition to multiple restorative and conservation efforts – all of which, in turn, require public support for success. However, scientific understanding of threats to marine ecosystems has not paralleled public understanding of those threats in many jurisdictions. Highly complex, interwoven, distant, vulnerable to multiple stressors, and hosting biota that are biologically unfamiliar to people, marine ecosystems present unique communication challenges. 2.The merits of effective communication capable of motivating behavioural change, policy action and support for marine conservation are often emphasized. To date, however, environmental communication, as a field, has largely focused on terrestrial ecosystems and more recently on climate change, leaving research-informed marine conservation communication neglected. 3.Adding to the small compilation of marine conservation communication literature, this integrative review provides a new understanding of how six message frames (emotional, problem/solution, outcome, value-based, distance, and social norm) can interactively help enhance the effectuality of conservation messages. Insights from the framing-related literature are merged with those from relevant fields including the theoretical literature, and the behavioural, social, and environmental sciences to define concepts, provide examples and explain the relevance of the six identified frames. The potential strength of these frames are discussed and suggestions on how they might be used to communicate different marine conservation issues are provided. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","communication campaign; frames; framing; marine conservation communication; marine ecosystems; public communication; public outreach","biota; climate change; conservation management; human activity; marine ecosystem; theoretical study","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85085038198",NA,NA

In this study, beach sand and surface water were sampled in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (APIS) in May and July 2018. Additional sand samples were collected at non-APIS beaches in western Lake Superior in May 2018. Microlitter particles (&lt;4 mm), consisting of microplastics and other low-density particles, were enumerated. Microplastics in sand samples, as identified by melt test, exhibited low abundances (0 to 55 particles/kg dry weight) and were mainly fibers. Microplastics in water samples were also low in abundance (9000 to 40,000 particles/km2) and were mostly fibers. Pyrolysis gas chromatography (pyGCMS) analysis was performed on a subset of microplastics from the sand and water samples. All particles with identifiable mass spectra were polyethylene. When beach sands were processed by density fractionation and filtration, the resulting microlitter samples also contained 260 to 2630 non-plastic particles per kg dry weight. A subset of these non-melting particles was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Results indicated that both organic and inorganic particles were included within non-plastic microlitter. Re-analysis of additional aliquots of the same sand samples using oxidation in addition to density fractionation reduced the number of non-plastic particles by roughly half, further highlighting that many of these were organic. Post-oxidation surface-water microlitter (333 μm to 4 mm) also contained non-plastic low-density particles, which comprised 29 to 47% of the total microlitter particle counts. Based upon color distributions, non-plastic microlitter particles in sand and water samples include a small portion of particles identifiable as anthropogenic. The sources for many microlitter particles cannot be distinguished at present and may be natural in origin. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Beach sands; Lake Superior; Microlitter; Microplastics; Water","Beaches; Gas chromatography; Lakes; Mass spectrometry; Microplastic; Polyethylenes; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray spectroscopy; Color distribution; Density fractionations; Inorganic particles; Low-density particles; Natural systems; Particle counts; Plastic particle; Pyrolysis gas chromatography; Sand; fresh water; lake water; microplastic; organic matter; polyethylene; sea water; fractionation; oxidation; plastic waste; pristine environment; sand; surface water; Article; controlled study; dry weight; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; filtration; human; microplastic pollution; oxidation; particle size; population abundance; priority journal; pyrolysis gas chromatography; quality control; sand; scanning electron microscopy; sea surface waters; seashore; water analysis; water sampling; Apostle Islands; Apostle Islands National Lakeshore; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Superior; United States; Wisconsin","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85088014020",NA,NA

Mitigation measures that target specific materials or value chain stages may therefore have incremental or even adverse net environmental effects. In this perspective, we develop a framework for applying life cycle thinking to identify key impacts and corresponding mitigation approaches, inform building design and material selection, and ensure effective treatment and recycling of construction and demolition wastes. Life cycle evaluation can also be used to assess and avoid environmental trade-offs among life cycle stages.

Today, when the cost of degradable agricultural mulch film is much higher than that of ordinary agricultural mulch film, appropriate policy tools must be identified. However, relevant research is relatively rare. This paper attempts to understand the acceptability of households of policy tools by investigating households' willingness to apply degradable agricultural mulch film to reduce agricultural mulch film pollution and their requirements for compensation proportion, to make this sector cleaner and pay more attention to the implementation of sustainability principles. The sample is five cities in Hubei province, China; the study is based on extended planned behavior (TPB) theory; and we use the double-hurdle model to analyze “whether to accept compensation” and “proportion of compensation” of households. The main results show that the more households know about policies, the higher the proportion of compensation required. However, households with high knowledge of ecological value are willing to adopt degradable agricultural mulch films even if the government provides less compensation. In addition, risk-biased households are willing to voluntarily bear more additional costs of degradable agricultural mulch films. The results obtained have multiple meanings. First, in today's rural areas of China, compared with the formal government regulations, informal regulations are the key factors to promote degradable agricultural mulch films application. Second, the enhancement of the understanding of the knowledge of ecological value can effectively improve households' consciousness of using degradable agricultural mulch film. Third, to realize the sustainability of policies, households' risk attitude must be strengthened. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Degradable agricultural mulch film; Double-hurdle model; Environmental knowledge; Risk attitude; Willingness to accept compensation","Agricultural robots; Laws and legislation; Pollution control; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Additional costs; Double hurdle model; Ecological values; Environmental knowledge; Government regulation; Planned behavior; Sustainability principles; Willingness to accept; Agriculture; environmental values; knowledge; mulching; planning theory; regulatory approach; risk assessment; rural policy; sustainability; willingness to pay; article; attitude; China; city; compensation; consciousness; government regulation; household; human; human experiment; mulch; rural area; theoretical study; China; Hubei","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85088526745",NA,NA

One promising tool for increasing the spatiotemporal coverage of OMP data sets is through the active involvement of citizen volunteers to expand the scale of OMP monitoring. Working collaboratively with volunteers from the Citizens Statewide Lake Assessment Program (CSLAP), we conducted the first statewide study on OMP occurrence in surface waters of New York lakes. Samples collected by CSLAP volunteers were analyzed for OMPs by a suspect screening method based on mixed-mode solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Sixty-five OMPs were confirmed and quantified in samples from 111 lakes across New York. Hierarchical clustering of OMP occurrence data revealed the relevance of 11 most frequently detected OMPs for classifying the contamination status of lakes. Partial least squares regression and multiple linear regression analyses prioritized three water quality parameters linked to agricultural and developed land uses (i.e., total dissolved nitrogen, specific conductance, and a wastewater-derived fluorescent organic matter component) as the best combination of predictors that partly explained the interlake variability in OMP occurrence. Lastly, the exposure-activity ratio approach identified the potential for biological effects associated with detected OMPs that warrant further biomonitoring studies. Overall, this work demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating citizen science approaches into the regional impact assessment of OMPs. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","","Agricultural robots; Aquatic ecosystems; Hierarchical clustering; Land use; Least squares approximations; Linear regression; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Multivariant analysis; Phase separation; Risk assessment; Screening; Water quality; Watersheds; Environmental implications; Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometries; Mixed-mode solid-phase extraction; Multiple linear regression analysis; Multivariate statistical analysis; Organic micro-pollutants; Partial least squares regression; Water quality parameters; Lakes; atrazine; diethyltoluamide; dissolved organic matter; fluridone; icaridin; lake water; metolachlor; nitrogen; noradrenalin; protriptyline; surface water; aquatic ecosystem; cluster analysis; hierarchical system; lake water; organic pollutant; pollution incidence; risk assessment; water quality; agricultural land; Article; citizen science; controlled study; environmental exposure; hierarchical clustering; human; human experiment; lake; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; New York; normal human; organic pollution; volunteer; water contamination; water pollutant; water quality; New York [United States]; United States","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85095461583",NA,NA

Indeed, replacing natural aggregates with recycled aggregates obtained from concrete waste lowers the environmental impact of concrete constructions and improves natural resource conservation. This paper reports on an experimental study on mechanical and durability properties of concretes casted with recycled aggregates obtained from two different parent concretes, belonging to two structural elements of the old Cagliari stadium. The effects of parent concretes on coarse recycled aggregates and on new structural concretes produced with different replacement percentages of these recycled aggregates are investigated. Mechanical properties (compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and splitting tensile strength) and durability properties (water absorption, freeze thaw, and chloride penetration resistance) are experimentally evaluated and analyzed as fundamental features to assess structural concrete behavior. The results show that the mechanical performance of recycled concrete is not related to the parent concrete characteristics. Furthermore, the resistance to pressured water penetration is not reduced by the presence of recycled aggregates, and instead, it happens for the chloride penetration resistance. The resistance to frost–thawing seems not related to the recycled aggregates replacement percentage, while an influence of the parent concrete has been assessed. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper reports a life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis of a proposed natural fiber-reinforced biopolymer composite takeout food container. The study focuses on the damage assessment of the whole product system, including disposal scenarios of the thermoformed sugar palm fiber (SPF)-reinforced sago starch composite takeout food container. The analysis performed was to anticipate the environmental impact of the cradle-to-grave approach. The results exhibited the total human health damage of 2.63 × 10−5 DALY and ecosystem damage of 9.46 × 10−8 species.year per kg of containers. The main contributor was the carbon dioxide emission from fossil fuel combustion for energy generation that contributed to climate change and caused human health and the ecosystem damages with low-level metrics of 1.3 × 10−5 DALY and 7.39 × 10−8 species.yr per kg of containers, respectively. The most contributed substances in the ‘Particulate matter formation’ impact categories that caused respiratory diseases were from air/nitrogen oxides, air/particulates, &lt;2.5 µm, and air/sulphur dioxide with the metrics of 2.93 × 10−6 DALY, 2.75 × 10−6 DALY, and 1.9 × 10−6 DALY per kg containers, correspondingly. Whereas, for the ‘Agricultural land occupation’, which contributed to ecosystem damage, almost the total contributions came from raw/occupation, forest, intensive with the metric of 1.93 × 10−9 species.yr per kg of containers. Nevertheless, from the results, all impact categories impacted below than 0.0001 DALY for the Human Health damage category and below 0.00001 species.yr for the ecosystem damage category.

They are either temporary or permanent structures (banquettes) and represent a valuable resource, with important ecosystem functions including coastal protection against erosion. Nevertheless, the perception of these plant accumulations by the different stakeholders (beach managers, local administrations and tourists) is often negative; they consider these deposits a malevolent waste to be removed, rather than a natural and valuable component of the coastline. We propose an integrated/beneficial management model for posidonia deposits, called ECOLOGICAL BEACH, firstly proposed in France, and recently implemented and applied in Italy. The model promotes the preservation of posidonia beach casts on site, with a balanced coexistence of natural and anthropic elements. The model fosters the several important ecosystem services of the beach casts and contributes to coastal preservation. To successfully spread the model, several activities must be implemented: a regulatory framework, the collection of data about the occurrence of beach casts, management protocols and educational programs. The most important activity is the educational one, based on the dissemination of the ecological and economic value of the beach casts, aimed at switching the perception of this phenomenon towards positive appraisal. © 2020 by the authors.

The main objective of this study was to analyze the optimum age of garbage heaps to obtain the right time on the recovery of the landfills. Five excavation points were prepared at 4–5, 6–7, 8–9, 10–11, and > 12 years. Each excavated material was dried, separated, and grouped according to each component, and then weighed, tabulated, and shown as a percentage of excavated garbage composition. The result shows that landfill mining can be carried out at a garbage heap aged 8–9 years in which compost landfill mining has obtained at 50%. Other discussions concern the existence of organic and nonorganic components as well as the usage of plastic bags and nappies indicating the lifestyle changes of the people. © 2020","compost landfill mining; landfill; landfill mining; organic solid waste","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85096215425",NA,NA

Furthermore, it provides an overview on land use change (LUC) impacts accounted for, methodologies chosen, and the results obtained. Methods: Studies related to the impact assessment of bioplastics and published between 2007 and 2018 were gathered. Five keyword strings were used to perform a wide search and select relevant LCA studies. The study aimed to analyze critical methodological aspects in LCA, in order to determine the most common choices made during biobased material analyses, as well as major limitations. Three filters were applied to select comparable studies, ending with a final number of 17 papers. Recommendations were obtained by comparing common practices performed by different authors with suggested best available practices mentioned in handbooks and guidelines. Interestingly, LUC metrics and impacts were, most of the time, neglected. Thus, a specific assessment and discussion was performed regarding the methods used to quantify LUC impacts, considering its importance during the production of biobased materials. Results and discussion: The study discussed the main environmental problems linked to the development of new biomaterials. LCA of agricultural products or systems, when compared with fossil-based counterparts, is expected to show higher environmental impacts in categories directly affected by fertilizer use, occupied and transformed land, among others. Thus, studies that included additional impact categories besides global warming (e.g., eutrophication or acidification) concluded that biobased materials present higher impacts, recommending improvements in farming practices to improve their overall environmental profile. Moreover, this review gathered methodologies used to account for LUC impacts and the results obtained. The main constraint of including LUC impacts was the lack of a standardized methodology, as well as large uncertainties in existing methodologies. Conclusions: Most studies concluded that improvements in farming practices might reduce the attributed environmental impacts with the reduction of the amount of land, fertilizer, pesticides, and water used. Studies computing LUC impacts agreed on the importance of including these impacts and concluded that greenhouse gas emissions of bioplastic production would increase, but in most cases would still be lower than the impact of their fossil-based counterparts. However, challenges remain when computing LUC impacts that need to be tackled when working with the available methodologies, including the collection of reliable inventory data (site-specific or regional data) and regionalized characterization factors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bioplastics; Biopolymers; GHG emissions; Land use changes; Life cycle assessment; LUC","biomaterial; bioplastic; biopolymer; fertilizer; pesticide; unclassified drug; acidification; agricultural procedures; carbon footprint; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; fertilizer application; fossil; greenhouse effect; land use; life cycle assessment; methodology; pesticide spraying; priority journal; Review; synthesis; trend study","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85095599781",NA,NA

The evidence of MP contamination in terrestrial environment is less explored compared to aquatic bodies. However, in Bangladesh despite having high possibility of MP contamination, there is lacking of available research-based evidence. Urban areas soil is subjected to act as a major environmental reservoir for MPs. Thus, this study was carried out to investigate the presence of MP contamination in constructed landfill sites near Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Ten unmixed soil samples were collected from the Aminbazar Sanitary landfill sites, from that thirty replicated samples were investigated via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis and Stereomicroscope. The range of physicochemical parameters were found in the soil samples as follows: moisture content; 15.84%–56.54%; soil pH; 5.76–6.02, electric conductivity; 0.1 μs/cm - 2.43 μs/cm, alkalinity; 6.7 ± 1.528–14.33 ± 0.577, TOC; 0.18% ± 0.02–1.09 ± 0.03. Among the ten samples, 3 samples were identified to have the presence of MP in the form of Low density polyethylene (LDPE), High density polyethylene (HDPE), and Cellulose acetate (CA) respectively. The detection limit ranged from 1 – 2000 μm. Hence, the results show that the procurement and discharge of MPs in the landfills is an overlong process. The results of this study provide an initial evidence and affirm that landfill can be a potential source of MPs. This study indicates that MPs are comparatively overlong outcome of human induced activities which can significantly cause changes in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2020 The Author(s)","Agricultural science; Chemistry; Earth sciences; Environmental science; FT-IR; Materials science; Microplastic contamination; Microplastic identification; Soil; Stereomicroscope","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85096831801",NA,NA

Such impacts include physical changes to bottom substrate and habitats from sources such as anchoring and mooring and vessel groundings, alterations to the physico-chemical properties of the water column and aquatic biota through the application of antifouling paints, operational and accidental discharges (ballast and bilge water, hydrocarbons, garbage and sewage), fauna collisions, and various other disturbances. Various measures exist to sustainably manage these impacts. In addition to a review of associated boating-and shipping-related environmental impacts, this paper provides an outline of the governmentand industry-related measures relevant to achieving positive outcomes in an Australian context. Historically, direct regulations have been used to cover various environmental impacts associated with commercial, industrial, and recreational boating and shipping operations (e.g., MARPOL). The effectiveness of this approach is the degree to which compliance can be effectively monitored and enforced. To be effective, environmental managers require a comprehensive understanding of the full range of instruments available, and the respective roles they play in helping achieve positive environmental outcomes, including the pros and cons of the various regulatory alternatives. © 2020 by the authors.","Anti-fouling treatments; Benthic disturbance; Coastal environments; Environmental management; Hydrocarbon pollution; MARPOL; Sewage discharge; Species translocation; Water quality; Wildlife impacts","","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85096512474",NA,NA

Minimizing GHGs from agroecosystems without compromising crop yield for stabilization of green production systems remains a challenge. Being an integral component of wheat production technology, the nitrogen (N) application deems to be indispensable. Thus, to reduce the application of N fertilizer and keep in view the minimization of GHGs emission, without compromising soil fertility and wheat production, field experiments were performed with treatments included maize straw mulch (S1: 0, S2: 4500, S3: 9000 kg ha−1) and nitrogen fertilizer (N1: 0, N2: 192 and N3: 240 kg ha−1) during 2015–17. Results showed that the cumulative CO2 and N2O emission from 9000 kg ha−1 of maize straw mulch with 192 kg N ha−1 (S3N2) significantly decreased by 0.67% and 33.7%, respectively, averaged over two years compared with that of 9000 kg ha−1 of maize straw mulch with 240 kg N ha−1 (S3N3). Likewise, the average soil moisture content significantly increased by 10% and 10.6% for S3N2 and S3N3 treatments at 0–10 cm soil depth, respectively, compared to S1N1. Similarly, the S3N2 and S3N3 treatments had lowered the soil temperature by 0.2 and 0.1 °C, respectively, over S1N1 in wheat grown fields. The grain yield of wheat was increased by 45% and 45% under S3N3 and S3N2 treatments than S1N1, respectively. The S3N2 treatment was more economical than S3N3 for wheat crop. Therefore, maize straw mulch (S3) combined with 20% less N fertilizer (N2) from commercial source were considered as a viable production technology to improve crop yield, and reduce soil CO2 and N2O emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 and N2O emission; Grain yield; Nitrogen fertilizer; Soil moisture; Soil temperature","Carbon dioxide; Crops; Greenhouse gases; Soil moisture; Commercial sources; Field experiment; Green production; Integral components; Nitrogen fertilization; Production technology; Soil temperature; Wheat production; Nitrogen fertilizers; nitrogen fertilizer; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; crop yield; fertilizer application; maize; mulching; nitrogen; nitrogen oxides; straw; wheat; yield response; agricultural parameters; agricultural procedures; agroecosystem; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; economic evaluation; fertilization; grain yield; green chemistry; greenhouse gas; harvest; inorganic chemistry; maize; nitrous oxide emission; nutrient; priority journal; risk reduction; soil depth; soil fertility; soil moisture; soil nutrient; soil pollution; soil temperature; straw mulching; wheat; wheat production; agriculture; China; soil; wheat; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; China; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Triticum; Zea mays","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85086990461",NA,NA

In recent trends, urban mining of these metals has received significant attention due to its profitable prospects, extended business opportunity, source of livelihood and ultimately achieving agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030. At the same time, the significant E-waste turns out to be an overwhelming challenge due to the presence of toxic chemical substances. The colossal E-waste generation has created multi-dimensional challenges over existing treatment options with its deleterious impacts on human health and environment. Most of the developed countries are having potential E-waste management technologies, technical knowhow and well-established system boundary. However, the case is not the same with the developing countries due to several challenges and lack of relevant strategies. Lack of data inventorization, illegal dumping, and non-availability of treatment options are the major challenges affecting the entire E-waste value chain in India. Hence, this paper deals with the strategic interventions conforming existing regulations which are crucial for a sustainable E-waste value chain, secured resources, societal well-being, reduced environmental impacts and overall sustainable development. Furthermore, relevant strategies i.e., eco-product design, circular resource management, extended producer responsibility, polluter pays’ principle, life cycle assessment, 4R principle and bioleaching were identified and discussed as a future direction for Indian context.

Accordingly, many review papers have been published on this topic with various areas of focus. Nevertheless, the overall body of literature still lacks a systematic review that thoroughly explores sustainability-driven decisions in the agriculture sector. To fill this research gap, the present paper presents an extensive review of 247 quantitative studies on sustainable agricultural supply chains. Our review scope includes both crop-based and livestock sectors that are monitored by eco-social corporate initiatives or government sustainability-driven legislation. To do so, we employ a content analysis-based review method, which is well known as an effective means of conducting literature reviews in a transparent, systematic, and rule-governed way, to rigorously collect, filter, and classify the existing research context. We classify the collected materials based on different structural dimensions and related analytic categories, which are obtained from both deductive and inductive categorization techniques. More specifically, we thoroughly evaluate the review results from four research perspectives – agricultural planning, supply chain management, sustainability development, and modeling methodology – aiming at presenting an overview of quantitative research projects.

This study analysed the issue of marine plastic litter pollution in the context of the Descriptor 10 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Good Environmental Status of the oceans and seas. The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was used to assess the causes, effects, and management measures to changes in the marine environment resulting from marine plastics pollution. We noted that less than 10 peer-reviewed publications have applied the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model to the issue of marine plastics pollution. Some basic needs such as food security, movement of goods and services, and shelter are also some of the major drivers of marine plastic pollution. The use of plastics is linked to multiple economic sectors (fisheries, agriculture, transport, packaging, construction) and other human activities. A significant amount of the resulting pressures came from the economic sectors for packaging and construction. State changes occurred at the environmental (contamination and bioaccumulation), ecosystem (ingestion of plastics, ghost fishing) and ecosystem service levels (supply of sea food, salt and cultural benefits), with possible loss of jobs and income being some of the observed impacts on human welfare. Responses as management measures, which are tailored to meet each component of the DPSIR framework, were identified. These included policies, regulations, technological advancement and behavioural change. The research acknowledges the issue of marine plastics pollution as a global environmental problem and recommends a trans-disciplinary approach, involving all types of stakeholders.

The Chinese “Sponge City Program” (SCP), initiated in 2013 and adopted by 30 pilot cities, is developing solutions to manage urban flood risk, purify stormwater, and provide water storage opportunities for future usage. Emerging challenges to the continued implementation of Sponge Cities include (1) uncertainty regarding future hydrological conditions related to climate change projections, which complicates urban planning and designing infrastructure that will be fit for purpose over its intended operating life, and (2) the competing priorities of stakeholders and their reluctance to make trade-offs, which obstruct future investment in the SCP. Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) is an umbrella concept that emerged from Europe, which encourages the holistic idea of considering wider options that combine “Blue–Green” practices with traditional engineering to deliver “integrated systems of Blue–Green–Grey infrastructure”. NBS includes interventions making use of natural processes and ecosystem services for functional purposes, and this could help to improve current pilot SCP practices. This manuscript reviews the development of the SCP, focusing on its construction and design aspects, and discusses how approaches using NBS could be included in the SCP to tackle not only urban water challenges but also a wide range of social and environmental challenges, including human health, pollution (via nutrients, metals, sediments, plastics, etc.), flood risk, and biodiversity. © 2020 by the authors.

Circular Economy (CE) is a sustainable development approach that works on the waste management strategy of reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover. Considerable work has been performed on CE in various sectors such as in electronic sector, construction sector, automotive sector, etc. However, CE in the water sector is gaining rapid attention, because of imbalance in water resources and the prevailing linear approach. The aim of this study is to review the world-wide growth of CE concept in the water sector from an economic, environmental, social, and technical perspective. 98 publications were selected by systematic literature review and categorized in economic, environmental, social, and technical criteria including a combination of multiple criteria. In this study, the world-wide status of CE implementation in the water sector is assessed and strategies to encourage and enhance CE implementation are proposed. The six BS8001:2017 principles and 6Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle, reclaim, recover, restore) of waste management are critically analyzed for deriving recommendations and successful implementation of CE in water sector.

Especially 70% of the world's e-waste ends up in Guiyu, a small town located in Guangdong Province of China. As little as 25% is recycled in formal recycling centers with adequate protection for workers and the other e-waste arrived in those areas is not handled in organized manner. As per reports only roughly 12.5% of e-waste is actually recycled, and the recycling efforts in those regions are primitive and result in toxic substances being leached into the surrounding ecosystems. In addition to persistent organic pollutants, there are many heavy metals found in the ground and river sediments in Guiyu, exceeding the threshold set to protect human health. Those areas are no longer suitable for growing food, and water is unsafe for drinking, due to the amount of toxins leached into the groundwater and land. Hazardous threats to environment and human health due to hazardous substances of e-waste all around China, as well as the current e-waste management were documented in this review.

In order to implement these systems, it is necessary to replace the traditional model of ""extract-use-consume-dispose"" with a model based on the principles of the Circular Economy (CE), optimizing the use of resources and minimizing the generation of waste. Almería has become a paradigm of this type of high-yield agricultural system, with the largest concentration of greenhouses in the world. This study analyses the opportunities that the CE can offer the intensive agriculture sector in Almería in order to obtain long-Term sustainability. The results show a wide variety of alternatives, both on an agricultural exploitation level and in the case of the product packaging and wholesale centers. The priority areas of action are waste management, the prevention of product waste and the improvement in the efficiency of the use of water and energy. The principal limitations for adopting circular practices are the large investment required, the limited transfer of knowledge between the different users and the lack of sufficient support from the government and the sector. © 2020 MDPI AG.

However, there are few studies on CEs from rice production in Southwest China (SWC) (including Yunnan Province (YNP), Sichuan Province, Guizhou Province, and Chongqing Municipality (CQM)), which has complex topography and climatic conditions. Here, a set of indicators based on yield, economic output, EC, and CEs were proposed to describe the performance of rice production in SWC during 2004–2016. The research results reflected that (1) the share of indirect EC of rice production was 75.46% in SWC, more than 90% of which originated from nitrogen fertilizer, compound fertilizer, and pesticides; (2) direct CEs contributed to 55.20% of the total CEs in SWC during the study period, and fertilizer production and utilization were the largest contributor (45.03%) to CEs in this area, followed by paddy fields (38.61%); (3) CQM had the worst performance in SWC in terms of CE intensity of economic output and profit from land use; (4) YNP had the greatest EC intensity based on yield, the greatest CE intensity based on sowing area and yield, and the worst production structure and comprehensive performance; and (5) the structure of rice production was optimized to different degrees in SWC, but no obvious improvement was seen in relationships between yield, economic output, EC, and CEs in this area. Therefore, measures should be taken to reduce the EC intensity and CE intensity of rice production in YNP, and rice plantation methods with high yield and fine quality should be emphasized in the other three administrative regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Energy consumption; Rice production; Scale harmony degree; Southwest China","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Cultivation; Energy utilization; Food supply; Global warming; Land use; Topography; Climatic conditions; Complex topographies; Compound fertilizer; Comprehensive performance; Fertilizer production; Performance assessment; Production structures; Sichuan province; Nitrogen fertilizers; carbon emission; climate conditions; crop production; crop yield; cultivation; economic analysis; fertilizer application; fuel consumption; global warming; nitrogen; performance assessment; rice; topography; China; Chongqing; Guizhou; Sichuan; Yunnan","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85087201827",NA,NA

Here, we examined which strategies would be adopted by plants for alleviating P deficiency caused by N enrichment from the perspective of aboveground conservation and belowground uptake. To achieve this objective, we conducted a five-year N-addition experiment (0 and 50 kg N ha−1 yr−1) in a 60-year-old larch (Larix kaempferi) plantation, and measured variables related to ecosystem P status, leaf P resorption, soil exploration by roots and extraradical hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi, and rhizosphere effects on soil P cycling. We found that N addition significantly reduced soil available P concentration and enhanced leaf N:P ratio, indicating the increasing degree of P deficiency under N addition. Leaf P resorption efficiency and proficiency were significantly enhanced by N addition, implying the increase in aboveground P conservation. Moreover, N addition significantly increased root length density and decreased ectomycorrhizal extraradical hypha biomass, suggesting the enhanced role of the root pathway in scavenging soil P.

Organic agriculture and community-supported agriculture are considered as two alternatives to reduce the environmental burdens related to agricultural production. In order to gain a better understanding of both agroecosystems, an on-site survey was conducted via a semi-structured questionnaire on eight conventional (CON), eight organic (ORG), and seven community-supported agriculture (CSA) farms of greenhouse vegetable production in the peri-urban region of Beijing China. Environmental impacts and economic performance were analyzed with life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), and eco-efficiency methods. The results indicated that CSA farms exhibited the lowest integrated environmental impact index, which was 29% and 82% lower than those of ORG and CON farms, respectively. Specifically, ORG farms exhibited the highest soil eco-toxicity potential and aquatic eutrophication potential, and this is mainly due to the heavy application of off-farm manures. The LCCs of CON, ORG, and CSA farms corresponded to 29.2, 65.5, and 74.0 thousand USD/ha, respectively. Labor incurred the highest cost accounting for 32%, 50% and 38% of total cost in CON, ORG and CSA farms, respectively. Additionally, CSA farms exhibited the highest gross income (40.74 thousand USD/ha), and this was followed by ORG (21.13 thousand USD/ha) and CON (14.31 thousand USD/ha) farms. Besides, CSA farms also exhibited the highest cost-benefit ratio with 0.51, while ORG farms exhibited the lowest cost-benefit ratio of 0.28. CSA farms also showed the highest eco-efficiency when compared with CON and ORG farms, implying that they achieved more profit with lower environmental impacts.

In environmental alliances, firms collaboratively exploit and explore environmental technologies to address market opportunities while simultaneously generating positive environmental impacts. A striking idiosyncrasy is that in addition to economic value, environmental alliances generate two types of external value: environmental value from positive effects on air, water, land and biodiversity, and knowledge value from innovations in environmental technologies. Research on motivations for environmental alliances is dispersed and underdeveloped compared to the well-established literature on motivations for strategic alliances that emphasize economic value. This study therefore develops a classification of motivations for environmental alliances by combining the literature on strategic alliances and that on environmental and knowledge value. The resulting classification includes motivations for environmental alliances to generate environmental and knowledge value as well as motivations to create economic value by internalizing environmental and knowledge value. A systematic review of 123 articles on environmental inter-firm alliances identifies specific motivations to populate the new classification. We show that alliance partners are motivated to share sustainable resources, reduce sustainability risk, respond to stakeholders or invest in specific sustainable assets to generate external value. They collaborate to reduce costs or enhance competitive advantage, reputation or legitimacy to internalize external value. The resource-based view, resource-dependence view, institutional theory and transaction cost economics have not previously distinguished between motivations to generate and internalize external value. We extend their area of application from strategic alliances to environmental alliances, and thus beyond the exclusive pursuit of economic value. © 2020 The Authors.

Enzyme activity and soil physicochemical properties were measured. A redundancy analysis showed that the RE and CS treatments had positive effects on soil nutrient and enzyme activity compared to that of the BF and CT treatments. The CS and RE treatments increased β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, and β-xylosidase activities. In addition, the CS treatment significantly enhanced the β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and urease activities compared to that under CT treatment. However, the activity of these enzyme was reduced in the BF treatment compared with that of the CT treatment. The results also indicated that the enzymes activities were not completely consistent with the changing trends of the genes encoding these enzymes. In addition, the RE and CS treatments also increased the abundance of genes encoding carbohydrate enzymes. It is interesting that the RE and CS treatments had more pathway genes associated with the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, and amino acid metabolism compared with the BF treatment. Remarkably, RE and CS treatments effectively increased the abundance of carbon fixation gene cbbL compared to CT treatment. In summary, organic mulching practices increased the soil microbiological functional diversity related to the carbon and nitrogen cycle, while inorganic mulching practice reduced them. This study enhanced our understanding of how mulching practices may alter soil microbial functional diversity and benefit soil quality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Enzyme activities; Functional diversity; Microorganism; Mulching; Orchard; Soil quality","beta glucosidase; cellulose 1,4 beta cellobiosidase; cytosol aminopeptidase; glycosidase; glycosyltransferase; isoleucine; leucine; n acetyl beta glucosaminidase; phenylalanine; polysaccharide lyase; tryptophan; tyrosine; urease; valine; xylan 1,4 beta xylosidase; carbon; enzyme activity; genomics; microbial community; mulching; physicochemical property; soil microorganism; soil nutrient; soil quality; species diversity; amino acid metabolism; Article; carbon cycle; carbon fixation; China; conventional tillage; enzyme activity; field experiment; intercropping; loess; Malus pumila; metagenomics; microbial diversity; mulch; nitrogen cycle; nutrient; orchard; perennial ryegrass; physical chemistry; soil microflora; soil moisture; soil quality; agriculture; microbiology; soil; China; Loess Plateau; Lolium; Lolium perenne; Malus x domestica; Agriculture; Carbon; China; Soil; Soil Microbiology","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85086805622",NA,NA

In fact, research has outlined that urban areas depend on global supply chains for their day-to-day basic functions, including energy supplies, food and safe access to potable water. The disruption of global supply chains can leave many urban areas in a very vulnerable position, in which their citizens may struggle to obtain their basic supplies, as the COVID-19 crisis has recently shown. Therefore, solutions aiming to enhance local food, water and energy production systems, even in urban environments, have to be pursued. The COVID-19 crisis has also highlighted in the scientific community the problem of people’s exposure to outdoor and indoor pollution, confirmed as a key element for the increase both in the transmission and severity of the contagion, on top of involving health risks on their own. In this context, most nations are going to adopt new preferential policies to stimulate the development of relevant sustainable energy industries, based on the electrification of the systems supplied by renewable energy sources as confirmed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Thus, while there is ongoing research focusing on a COVID 19 vaccine, there is also a need for researchers to work cooperatively on novel strategies for world economic recovery incorporating renewable energy policy, technology and management. In this framework, the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES) conference provides a good platform for researchers and other experts to exchange their academic thoughts, promoting the development and improvements on the renewable energy technologies as well as their role in systems and in the transition towards sustainable energy systems. The 14th SDEWES Conference was held in Dubrovnik, Croatia. It brought together around 570 researchers from 55 countries in the field of sustainable development. The present Special Issue of Energies, specifically dedicated to the 14th SDEWES Conference, focuses on four main fields: energy policy for sustainable development, biomass energy application, building energy saving, and power plant and electric systems. © 2020 by the authors.

To explore possible future ecological effects of N fertilizer rate, a DeNitrification–DeComposition (DNDC) model combined with Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) projections (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were used to predict the CF and ESVCS of rice production. The model was validated by a two-year field experiment, and then seven N fertilizer levels (0, 75, 150, 190, 225, 300, and 375 kg N/ha) were set for prediction from 2015 to 2050. The validation results indicated a good fit between the DNDC-simulated and observed data of GHG emission and rice yield. Under RCP 8.5, the mean CF was 4.5–8.7% higher and the average ESVCS was 3.6–7.4% lower than those under RCP 4.5. The effects of N fertilizer rate on CF and ESVCS were consistent between the two climate change scenarios. In both RCPs, it was found that CF and ESVCS were mainly influenced by N fertilizer rate due to the latter's effect on CH4 emissions and crop carbon fixation. CH4 was the main contributor to CF during 2015–2050, accounting for 43.9–58.3% of the total CF. Agricultural inputs were also large contributors to CF, and N fertilizer increased the indirect GHG emissions by 24.6–122.2% compared with no N fertilization treatment. Among the studied N fertilizer rates, 190 kg N/ha was the optimal rate, obtaining the lowest CF and highest ESVCS. These results indicate that, under future climate change, an N fertilizer rate of 190 kg N/ha could achieve a trade-off between high yield, reduction of CF, and improvement of ESVCS in rice production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; DNDC model; GHG emissions; N fertilizer; Rice ecosystem","Agricultural robots; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Emission control; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Carbon sequestration; Climate change scenarios; Ecological effect; Ecosystem service values; Fertilizer rates; Field experiment; Nitrogen fertilizer rate; Validation results; Nitrogen fertilizers; methane; nitrogen fertilizer; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); crop production; crop yield; denitrification; ecosystem service; environmental economics; fertilizer application; future prospect; nitrogen; prediction; rice; trade-off; Article; calibration; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; climate change; crop production; ecosystem; harvest; prediction; priority journal; rice; simulation; soil acidity; soil texture; validation process","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85085260614",NA,NA

In this study, a thorough appraisal of the latest literature is conducted, providing an overview of the existing tools, methodologies and indicators that have been used to assess NBS for water management, as well as complete water systems considering the need of assessing both anthropogenic and natural elements. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers with respect to existing policies and regulations on NBS and circularity have been identified. The study concludes that the co-benefits of NBS for water management are not adequately assessed.

Manipulating both the physical and ecological structures of constructed wetlands has been the key to improve ecosystem services while reducing disservices. Herein, an experiment using simulated constructed wetlands was conducted to explore the effect of two different substrate sizes (fine sand or coarse sand), plant richness (1, 3, or 4 species), and plant species identity on ecosystem services. Results indicated that (1) only in microcosms with coarse sand, species richness enhanced nitrogen removal efficiency while reduced nitrous oxide emissions and that (2) the presence of Phalaris arundinacea increased nitrogen removal rate, and the presence of Rumex japonicus or Oenanthe javanica decreased nitrous oxide emissions; (3) however, the net ecosystem services (nitrogen removal, greenhouse gas emissions, biofuel production) of microcosms with fine sand were higher than those of microcosms with coarse sand, and (4) interestingly, there was no difference in net ecosystem services between microcosms with coarse sand (1033 yuan ha−1 day−1; 1 yuan ≈ 0.14 USD) and those with fine sand (1071 yuan ha−1 day−1) for the four-species mixtures. Hence, in practice, ensuring plant species richness with appropriate species in microcosms with coarse sand can improve ecosystem services to a level equal to that of microcosms with fine sand and help to prevent constructed wetlands from clogging. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Methane; Nitrogen removal; Nitrous oxide; Species identity; Species richness; Substrate particle size","biofuel; constructed wetland; ecosystem service; ecosystem structure; microcosm; plant; sand; species diversity; species richness; Oenanthe javanica; Phalaris arundinacea; Rumex japonicus; nitrogen; ecosystem; plant; sand; waste water; wetland; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Plants; Sand; Waste Water; Wetlands","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85086742707",NA,NA

The gray mangrove [Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh.] is the only widespread tree species in this region, providing a unique evergreen habitat that supports high mangrove-associated biodiversity and many ecosystem services of socio-economic importance. This study provides the first literature-based analysis of the status and historical development of mangrove science in Arabia. The goal was to identify trends and gaps in regional mangrove research, providing information essential to guiding future science and conservation programs. The analyses incorporated 400 publications from over six decades since the first article in 1955, each classified into 11 major research topics and including studies from each of the regional seas (Red Sea, Arabian Sea, Sea of Oman, and the Persian/Arabian Gulf). The results demonstrate that there has been exponential growth in research on regional mangroves in recent decades (particularly around human impacts and ecology). The study further reveals knowledge gaps in important research topics and geographical areas that could be exploited to provide insights into broader biogeographic issues. These results provide a comprehensive assessment of the growing body of knowledge on regional mangroves, and provide direction for future research that can guide conservation, management and scientific knowledge of these critical ecosystem engineers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Arabian Sea; Avicennia marina; Mangrove; Persian/Arabian Gulf; Red Sea; Sea of Oman","Biodiversity; Conservation; Comprehensive assessment; Conservation programs; Ecosystem engineer; Ecosystem services; Extreme environment; Global distribution; Historical development; Scientific knowledge; Ecosystems; biodiversity; conservation planning; ecosystem service; evergreen forest; extremophile; future prospect; historical ecology; knowledge based system; landscape ecology; landscape evolution; mangrove; species diversity; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Oman; Persian Gulf; Red Sea; Avicennia marina; Rhizophoraceae","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85087945298",NA,NA

Sufficient wet-waste biomass supports quickly building hydrothermal liquefaction facilities. Macroalgae-for-biofuel technology can be developed and straightforwardly implemented on SDG-achieving high protein seafood infrastructure. The analyses indicate a potential for (1) 0.5 billion tonnes/yr of seafood; (2) 20 million barrels/day of biofuel from solid waste; (3) more biocrude oil from macroalgae than current fossil oil; and (4) sequestration of 28 to 38 billion tonnes/yr of bio-CO2.

Apart from providing mechanical strength and support, the shell is an important site for adherence and growth of multiple types of algae and periphyton. Variations in the shell architecture are observed in the mussels both within a species and among different species. Considering the prospective utility of the shell of the freshwater mussels as a biological material, an assessment of the shell characteristics was accomplished using Corbicula bensoni and Lamellidens marginalis as model species. The calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content of the shells, physical features and mechanical strength were assessed along with the morphometric analysis. The CaCO3 content of the shell (upto 95% to 96% of the shell weight) of both the mussels was positively correlated with the shell length, suggesting increased deposition of CaCO3 in shells with the growth of the species. The cross sectioned views of FE-SEM images of the shells exhibited distinct layered structure with external periostracum and inner nacreous layer varying distinctly. In the growing region, the growth line was prominent in the mussel shells revealed through the FESEM images. In addition XRD, FTIR and EDS studies on the mussel shells confirmed the existence of both aragonite and calcite forms of the calcium carbonate crystals with the incidence of various functional groups. The mechanical strength of the mussel shells was explored through nanoindentation experiments, revealed significant strength at the nanoparticle level of the shells.

Cities have an important role in such an economy, not only as main consumers but also because vegetation provides numerous ecosystem services essential for the well-being of urban dwellers. Urban lands are, however, heavily burdened with both past and present activities and ongoing urbanization. Retrofitting obsolete and potentially contaminated brownfields provides an opportunity to engage with bio-based land uses within the city. At the same time, plants are an important part of Gentle Remediation Options (GROs), a more sustainable alternative for managing contamination risks and restoring soil health. This paper (1) provides a tentative selection of Urban Greenspaces (UGSs) relevant for brownfields, and a compilation of ecosystem services provided by the selected UGSs, and (2) presents a framework covering the 14 selected bio-based land uses on brownfields, including GRO interventions over time. This framework provides three practical tools: the conceptualization of linkages between GROs and prospective UGS uses, a scatter diagram for the realization of 14 UGS opportunities on brownfields, and a decision matrix to analyze the requirements for UGS realization on brownfields. © 2020 by the authors.","Brownfields; Circular economy (CE); Gentle remediation options (GROs); Urban greenspace (UGS)","brownfield site; economic conditions; ecosystem service; land use; urban economy; urban population; urbanization","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85089813121",NA,NA

Identifying priorities necessary to engage grand challenges can be facilitated through horizon scanning exercises, and to this end we identified and examined 23 priority research questions needed to advance toward more sustainable environmental quality in Asia, as part of the Global Horizon Scanning Project. Advances in environmental toxicology, environmental chemistry, biological monitoring, and risk-assessment methodologies are necessary to address the adverse impacts of environmental stressors on ecosystem services and biodiversity, with Asia being home to numerous biodiversity hotspots. Intersections of the food–energy–water nexus are profound in Asia; innovative and aggressive technologies are necessary to provide clean water, ensure food safety, and stimulate energy efficiency, while improving ecological integrity and addressing legacy and emerging threats to public health and the environment, particularly with increased aquaculture production. Asia is the largest chemical-producing continent globally. Accordingly, sustainable and green chemistry and engineering present decided opportunities to stimulate innovation and realize a number of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Engaging the priority research questions identified herein will require transdisciplinary coordination through existing and nontraditional partnerships within and among countries and sectors. Answering these questions will not be easy but is necessary to achieve more sustainable environmental quality in Asia. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:1485–1505. © 2020 The Authors.

Unprecedented and continuous accumulation of growing plastic contaminants into any respective aquatic ecosystem by the anthropogenic sources causes direct and/or indirect interruption to ecosystem structure, functions, and consequently, services and values. Land-based and sea-based sources are the primary sources of these contaminants in various modes that enter the ocean. In this review paper, we focused on highlighting different aspects related to plastic pollution in coastal and marine environments. Plastic pollutants are distributed in the ecosystems in different forms, with different size variations as megaplastic, macroplastic, mesoplastic, and microplastic. Microplastics in primary and secondary forms reveal a widespread distribution in the water, sediment, and biota of the marine and coastal habitats. The microplastic level of different coastal and marine ecosystems nearly ranged from 0.001-140 particles/m3 in water and 0.2-8766 particles/m3 in sediments at different aquatic environments over the world. The microplastic accumulation rate of coastal and marine organisms varied at 0.1-15,033 counts. Accordingly, plastic pollution creates several kinds of negative consequences combined with ecological and socio-economic effects. Entanglement, toxicological effects via ingestion of plastics, suffocation, starvation, dispersal, and rafting of organisms, provision of new habitats, and introduction of invasive species are significant ecological effects with growing threats to biodiversity and trophic relationships. Degradation (changes in the ecosystem state) and modifications of marine systems are associated with loss of ecosystem services and values. Consequently, this emerging contaminant affects the socio-economic aspects through negative impacts on tourism, fishery, shipping, and human health. Preventing accumulation sources of plastic pollutants, 3Rs (Reduce-Recycle-Reuse), awareness &amp; capacity building, and producer/manufacturer responsibility are practical approaches toward addressing the issue of plastic pollution. Existing and adopted policies, legislations, regulations, and initiatives at global, regional, and national level play a vital role in reducing plastic debris in the marine and coastal zones. Development of proposals/solutions on key research gaps can open a novel pathway to address this environmental issue in an effective scientific manner. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the current status of plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem to make aware people of a plastic-free, healthy blue ocean in the near future. © 2020 The Author(s)","Aquatic ecology; Ecological health; Ecological restoration; Environmental analysis; Environmental assessment; Environmental hazard; Environmental health; Environmental management; Hydrology; Marine biology; Microplastics; Oceanography; Plastic sources; Pollution; Producer responsibility","","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85089847165",NA,NA

Focusing on the most commonly occurring consumer plastic items present in European freshwater environments, we identified and evaluated consumer-based actions with respect to their direct or indirect potential to reduce macroplastic pollution in freshwater environments. As the main end users of these items, concerned consumers are faced with a bewildering array of choices to reduce their plastics footprint, notably through recycling or using reusable items. Using a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach, we explored the effectiveness of 27 plastic reduction actions with respect to their feasibility, economic impacts, environmental impacts, unintended social/environmental impacts, potential scale of change and evidence of impact. The top ranked consumer-based actions were identified as: using wooden or reusable cutlery; switching to reusable water bottles; using wooden or reusable stirrers; using plastic free cotton-buds; and using refill detergent/ shampoo bottles. We examined the feasibility of top-ranked actions using a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) to explore the complexities inherent in their implementation for consumers, businesses, and government to reduce the presence of plastic in the environment. © 2020 Marazzi et al.

This study used plastic waste, a constituent of MSW, to explore the possibility of generating revenue for financing MSW management in the municipalities of Nepal. The results of this study suggest that plastic material recovery could generate revenue, which is equivalent to 1.38 times of the plastic-waste-related management cost when collection efficiency reaches 66.7%. An increase in 1% of recovery rate and collection efficiency could cover an additional 4.64% and 2.06% of the costs of managing plastic waste, respectively. In addition, an increase in tax on imported plastic materials could also motivate recovery of plastic waste for recycle and reuse. An additional 1% tax on plastic imports would be sufficient to cover plastic-related waste management when plastic waste recovery and collection efficiency rates are low. This plastic recovery-revenue exercise could be expanded to other materials such as paper and metal to fully understand the possibility of sustainable financing of MSW management and reducing environmental harm in developing countries like Nepal. © 2020 Bharadwaj et al.

Simplified outcomes from a detailed, consensus-based analysis by science-based NGO The Natural Step (TNS) took the form of five TNS sustainability challenges for PVC published in 2000. UK manufacturing companies initially used these challenges to direct strategic progress. The challenges have since been progressively taken up across European PVC value chains. The VinylPlus® program uses an updated version of the five challenges as a basis for voluntary commitments and transparent auditing of progress against published targets. Initial framing of the five TNS sustainability challenges for PVC was drafted consciously for generic relevance to other materials. Assessing the sustainability performance of some alternative materials to PVC against the five sustainability challenges reveals different sustainability performance in a range of potential applications. This highlights the danger inherent in automatic selection or deselection of materials in the absence of assessment of options on a “level playing field” of sustainability principles. The five TNS sustainability challenges for PVC remain valid today and into the longer-term future as a basis for making stepwise, profitable progress toward the goal of sustainability for PVC and other materials.

This paper proposes a generalized framework to design eco-industrial parks, and illustrates it with regard to the end-of-life vehicle problem (ELV). An eco-industrial park for end-of-life vehicles (EIP-4-ELVs) creates synergy in the network that leverages waste reduction and efficiently uses resources. The performance of the proposed framework is investigated along with the interactions between nodes. The proposed framework consists of five steps: (1) finding motivation for EIP, (2) identifying all entities with industrial symbiosis, (3) pinpointing the anchor entity, (4) determining industrial symbiosis between at least three entities and two exchange flows, and (5) defining exchange-flow types. The two last steps are connected by a feedback loop to allow future exchange flows. The proposed framework serves as a guideline for decision makers during the first stages of developing EIPs. Furthermore, the framework can be linked to car-design software to predict the recyclability of vehicle components and aid in manufacturing vehicles optimized for recycling. © 2020 by the authors.","Design framework; Eco-industrial park (EIP); End-of-life vehicles (ELVs); Industrial symbiosis (IS); Process optimization; Sustainability","automobile industry; design; guideline; industrial location; life cycle analysis; manufacturing; recycling; software; vehicle component; waste management","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85089854018",NA,NA

Thus, this article reports the trend of researches on the development of techniques to restore the quality of remediated soils to activate their reuse and recycling. Firstly, the tendency of change in soil properties through remediation processes was looked over, and then the degradation of soil quality was characterized according to the type of remediation processes. Besides, the direction of policy to promote the reuse and recycling of remediated soils was introduced, and finally, the future works needed were suggested. This article was prepared based on the results of the survey of domestic and foreign literature. A number of literature were reviewed to scrutinize the change of soil properties due to remediation processes and diverse techniques for the amendment and restoration of remediated soils. Furthermore, the policies related to the reuse and recycling of remediated soils were arranged with the reference of the first and second versions of the Soil Conservation Master Plan of Korea. The literature survey focused on three kinds of remediation technologies, such as land farming, soil washing, and thermal desorption, which were most frequently used so far in Korea. The results indicate that the tendency of change in soil properties was significantly different depending on the type of remediation processes applied, and the degradation characteristics of soil quality were also totally different between them. The soil amendment and restoration can be categorized as three techniques depending on the type of substances used, such as inorganic, organic, and biological ones. Diverse individual materials have been used, and the soil properties improved or enhanced were dependent on the type of specific materials utilized. However, few studies on the restoration of soil qualities degraded during the remediation processes have not been carried out so far. The second Soil Conservation Master Plan states the quality certification and target management system of remediated soils, and it is expected that their reuse and recycling will be facilitated hereafter. With the consideration of the type of remediation processes implemented and public utility, the restoration technologies of remediated soils should be developed for the vitalization of their reuse and recycling. Besides, practical and specific measures should be taken to support the policy specified in the second Soil Conservation Master Plan and to promote reuse/recycling of remediated soils. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided original work is properly cited.","Change of soil properties; Contaminated soils; Remediation processes; Restoration techniques; Soil quality","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85095787917",NA,NA

In anaerobic digestion, digestate is produced as a byproduct. This could be used to produce fertilizers and potting soils for home gardeners substituting mineral fertilizers or peat-based products. However, this depends on consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for such products, which we investigate in this study. To this end, we conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) with 507 private consumers. From the 6084 decisions made, we derived Bayesian part-worth utilities using a preference share model and so calculated the WTP for dierent proenvironmental attributes of potting-soil products. We also assessed the influence of proenvironmental attitudes on the WTP. We discovered five distinct consumer groups in our respondents. Some show a significant WTP for proenvironmental attributes such as ""organic"", ""peat free"", and ""without guano"". Three descriptions of digestate as a ""renewable resource"", a ""fermentation residue"", or a ""biogas residue"" elicited three markedly dierent WTP responses across all classes, with ""renewable resource"" garnering the highest WTP and ""biogas residue"" the lowest. Consumers with a stronger proenvironmental attitude exhibited a higher WTP for proenvironmental attributes.

Despite the wide use and importance attributed to the concepts of “restoration” and “regeneration,” they are rarely defined or explained in the circular economy literature. In this context, this study critically examines the two terms, while providing guidance on their future utilization and development. Specifically, the study investigates the origin of the concepts, their adoption in frameworks that anticipated the idea of the circular economy, and their connotations in the circular economy literature. The examination supports the need for clear and distinct definitions, combined with precision in usage. From a review of the literature, restoration is a better-defined concept than regeneration, although it needs conceptual re-enforcement relative to the biological/ecological aspects of the circular economy. This study suggests looking in the direction of restoration ecology, a well-established branch of ecological research. Conversely, regeneration is a symbolic/evocative term with little practical application in the context of circular systems except in the case of certain agricultural practices. Until new conceptual developments intervene, regeneration does not seem to be applicable to the economy as a whole and because of this, might be abandoned as a guiding principle of the circular economy. Unlike regeneration, restoration can be considered a core principle because it has widespread application and can be a point of reference for circular applications. This does not preclude the possibility that other concepts may be needed to augment restoration. © 2020 The Authors.

Sustainable agricultural practices based on low-external input is of paramount importance for reducing environmental trade-offs and planet healthy food production. Therefore, a critical assessment was made on viable low-input technologies aimed to reduce the negative effects of agricultural production as well as the use of various crop simulation models for forecasting the agricultural production under changing climatic scenario. While crop simulation models are helpful for predicting the growth and yield of individual crops under current as well as futuristic scenarios, it is difficult to model the response of multiple cropping systems under changing climatic conditions. As a matter of fact, the developing countries, majorly dependent on agriculture are most vulnerable to climate change. The increasing price of agrochemicals is another setback for subsistence farmers in resource-poor nations. In this backdrop, the current review aimed to assess the impact of climate change on agriculture, and the role of low input sustainable agriculture (LISA) for ensuring the food security while safeguarding the critical natural resources for human-wellbeing and also for attaining UN-Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, evidence-based impacts of LISA in emerging economies from Africa and South Asia are highlighted and suitable ecological indicators for measuring the sustainability of such LISA are addressed in brief. We conclude that the large-scale implementation of LISA will facilitate agricultural sustainability, and therefore, suitable policy frameworks are imperative for its worldwide adoption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Climate change; Low input sustainable agriculture; Simulation models; Sustainability indicators; UN-Sustainable Development Goals","Agricultural chemicals; Agricultural robots; Crops; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Forestry; Soil quality; Sustainable development; Agricultural productions; Agricultural sustainability; Crop simulation model; Ecological indicators; Global sustainability; Multiple cropping systems; Sustainable agricultural; Sustainable agriculture; Climate change; agricultural practice; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; climate change; environmental factor; farming system; food production; population growth; soil degradation; soil quality; sustainability; sustainable development; trade-off; warming; Africa; South Asia","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85083514924",NA,NA

With a range of outstanding properties, they are used in an ever-widening range of applications. However, the linear economy of their use means that a large volume of plastics is discarded after use. It is believed that approximately 80% of the estimated total 6.3 Bt of plastics ever produced have been discarded, representing not only a huge loss of valuable resources, but mismanaged waste is also the origin of an ever-increasing environmental disaster. Strategies to prevent loss of materials resources and damage to the environment are elements of a circular plastics economy that aims to maintain plastics at their highest value for the longest time possible and at the same time improve the economy and prevent detrimental environmental impact. The latter in particular is driving recent changes in policies and legislation across the world that are rapidly being introduced in order to solve these environmental issues. The achievement of a circular economy will require not only innovative technical developments, but also major economic investment and changes to business practice coupled with significant changes in social behaviour.

The circular economy has emerged as an alternative model to a traditional linear economy. It aims to tackle the resource exploitation that accompanies a linear economy and decouple economic growth from reliance on primary resources. In the face of global environmental degradation and an urgent need for change, the concept has become popular around the world and has led to the release of national policies and strategies on the circular economy. Problematically, while the basic concept is clear, it is ambiguous in how it will achieve some of its objectives, and it fails to address some key issues. In light of the accelerating rate of change, precipitous biodiversity decline is one such key issue. Through a content analysis of relevant circular economy publications, authors demonstrate that biodiversity protection is rarely mentioned in theory and policy. While the circular economy holds many benefits for society, its evasion of scrutiny has prevented it from manifesting in a comprehensive solution to environmental issues. The circular economy advocates for biomimicry, ecosystem service valuation, bioeconomy, and renewable energy. Each of these, however, has its own set of conflicts with biodiversity protection. Given the imminent need to protect biodiversity, the authors call for further research on the interaction between biodiversity and the circular economy, and for circular economy advocates to explicitly acknowledge the concept's limitations, thereby revealing the need for intersectional and complementary policies which aim to protect biodiversity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Bioeconomy; Biomimicry; Circular economy; Ecosystem services; Natural capital; Renewable energy","Biodiversity; Biomimetics; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Biodiversity protection; Content analysis; Economic growths; Ecosystem services; Environmental issues; National policies; Primary resources; Renewable energies; Economics; biodiversity; economic growth; economic system; environmental degradation; environmental issue; national planning; article; biodiversity; content analysis; economic aspect; ecosystem; renewable energy; economic development; environmental protection; policy; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economic Development; Ecosystem; Policy","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85083360116",NA,NA

However, such a transition is not trivial. Modifying production chains with the focus on reducing virgin raw materials consumption, cut emissions, and prevent waste generation implies implementing new processes and services, which can add considerable environmental impacts to the supply chain. This paper analyzes a real case from a production system aligned with circular economy principles. The production system consists of the manufacturing of baseboards made of recycled Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), obtained from an extensive reverse logistics system composed of different recycling processes. The system's potential environmental impacts were assessed by two widely used methodologies, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Emergy Analysis (EMA). For comparison purposes, the analysis was carried out for a fictional linear production system, in which the baseboard would be made of virgin EPS. EMA attributed a lower emergy load to the circular scenario compared to the linear scenario (8.62E+15 seJ to recycled EPS versus 1.26E+16 seJ to virgin EPS). LCA results indicate both scenarios as environmental preferable depending on the impact category under analysis (e.g. circular system has better performance regarding global warming, while the linear scenario demonstrated better results under water consumption). For the circular scenario, EMA identified the main impact drivers, such as transportation and electricity consumption. From LCA perspective impacts are also driven by electricity consumption. However, differently from EMA, logistics were only significant for Land Use impact category whereas Liquefied Petroleum Gas consumption and, landfill air emissions were identified as impact hotspots. These convergences and differences between the findings of LCA and EMA have demonstrated potentially complementation to broaden available information related to systems, enabling decision makers to act effectively in improving the environmental performance of their production processes, especially when implementing circular practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Emergy analysis; Expanded polystyrene; Life cycle assessment; Recycling","Decision making; Electric power utilization; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Global warming; Land use; Life cycle; Plastic recycling; Polystyrenes; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Electricity-consumption; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Linear production; Production process; Recycled expanded polystyrenes; Recycling process; Reverse logistics; Environmental impact; liquefied petroleum gas; polystyrene; environmental economics; environmental impact; landfill; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; recycling; waste management; waste technology; Article; controlled study; electricity; emergy analysis; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; intermethod comparison; land use; life cycle assessment; priority journal; recycling; traffic and transport","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85083290087",NA,NA

MPB photosynthesis was promoted in 18 chambers through a 12 h light/dark cycle. Another 18 chambers were maintained under dark conditions to inhibit photosynthesis.

The changes in MPB coincided with up to 75% lower energy reserves and reduced burrowing activity in M. liliana. In the light, nitrate + nitrate (NOx) was significantly elevated and related to M. liliana and MPB biochemical properties. Ammoniu (NH4+) concentrations increased but were variable in both the light and the dark. Our results suggest that increasing microfiber concentrations influence the interactions between M. liliana and MPB and affect biogeochemical processing in coastal marine sediments.

The aims of this study were to compare physical and chemical properties of GH with open-field (OF) soils, to clarify the buildup of heavy metals and phosphorus (P) in soils, and to assess the risks of selected heavy metals in soils and cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) from GH vegetables in Hamedan, western Iran. The average total and Olsen P of GH soils were significantly higher than the OF soils for both vegetables. The order of total and available heavy metal content in tomato GH soils has been set as zinc (Zn) > nickel (Ni) > chromium (Cr) > lead (Pb) > copper (Cu) > cadmium (Cd) and Zn > Cr > Cu > Pb > Ni > Cd, respectively. The same order was found for cucumber GH soils, except that the position of Pb and Cu was changed. The results indicated that in both GH cucumber and tomato soils, the mean content of total and available Zn, available Cu, Ni, and Pb, was extra than in OF soils. There were no significant differences between average total Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb in GH and OF soils. Tomato vegetables had higher heavy metal content and transfer factors, particularly for Cr than cucumber vegetables. According to the health risk indices, Cr and Pb represented a high potential risk for health through cucumber and tomato consumption. There were limited Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn inputs from the irrigation waters, while the input of Cr and Ni may be important. However, the amount of manure application and heavy metal content of the manures was significant. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cucumber; greenhouse; health risk; heavy metals; tomato","heavy metal; bioremediation; China; environmental monitoring; human; Iran; risk assessment; soil; soil pollutant; vegetable; Biodegradation, Environmental; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Iran; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Vegetables","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85085904754",NA,NA

In emerging economies such as those in the Coral Triangle, the communities affected are among the poorest of their countries. To understand the consequences of ocean plastic pollution in coastal regions, through the eyes of local people, this study examines the knowledge, use, disposal and local consequences of single use plastics in remote island communities in two archipelagos of southern Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using mixed methods—a survey of plastic literacy and behaviour, household interviews about purchasing and disposal, and focus group discussions to generate shared mental models—we identify a complex set of factors contributing to extensive plastic leakage into the marine environment. The rising standard of living has allowed people in low resource, remote communities to buy more single-use plastic items than they could before. Meanwhile complex geography and minimal collection services make waste management a difficult issue, and leave the communities themselves to shoulder the impacts of the ocean plastic crisis. Although plastic literacy is low, there is little the coastal communities can do unless presented with better choice architecture both on the supply side and in disposal options. Our results suggest that for such coastal communities improved waste disposal is urgent. Responsible supply chains and non-plastic alternatives are needed. Producers and manufacturers can no longer focus only on low-cost packaged products, without taking responsibility for the outcomes. Without access to biodegradable, environmentally friendly products, and a circular plastic system, coastal communities and surrounding marine ecosystems will continue to be inundated in plastic waste. © 2020 Phelan et al.

A significant case of plastic pollution occurs in the Galapagos Islands. The Galapagos Islands, located west of Ecuador, have one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. It is the home of unique species in the world, and since 1978 it has been considered as a Natural World Heritage. However, the Galapagos Islands are threatened by plastic pollution. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the cost of environmental damage generated by plastic waste in the Galapagos Islands. The non-market economic valuation approach was used to implement contingent valuation. It was determined that the Willingness to Pay of Ecuadorian families, to reduce plastic pollution, was between US$ 4.90 - US$ 14.51 per year, with a median of US$ 7.65.

Current environmental impact assessments generally focus on microscale and macroscale, while mesoscale studies at region level are lacking. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an LCA-based environmental impact assessment model for regulatory planning, which focuses on embodied EI of urban construction and operational EI associated with the operation of the built environment. To ensure the regulatory plans both meet the environmental limits and fit well with environmental policy requirements, this paper also presents a new impact analysis method by integrating environmental carrying capacity analysis and distance to target method. The Statutory Plan of Shenzhen Futian Free Trade Zone 03-T2 is used as a case study to test and demonstrate the applying process and functions of the proposed method. Results indicate that the proposed model can effectively quantify the future environmental impact associated with a regional development plan, and can potentially be used as a tool for urban administrators to make decisions on regulatory planning revision and provide references for environmental management. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","built environment; land use; neighborhood scale LCA; Territorial LCA; urban planning","Environmental impact assessments; Environmental management; International trade; Life cycle; Regional planning; Built environment; Distance to targets; Environmental carrying capacities; Environmental impact assessment models; Environmental performance; Environmental policy; Regional development; Urban construction; Environmental impact; carrying capacity; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; environmental policy; life cycle analysis; regional development; regulatory approach; urban planning; China; Futian; Guangdong; Shenzhen","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85083648192",NA,NA

Here we explore this idea, specifically in the context of what we consider “the concrete conquest of aquatic ecosystems.” The ubiquitous use of concrete in transportation and building infrastructure has contributed to alterations in freshwater and coastal marine systems. Yet, in some cases, there are no appropriate alternative building materials such that concrete itself is confounded by its application. For example, as the foundation for most dams, concrete fragments rivers and channelizes streams, often creating unnatural systems, yet dams are necessary for hydropower generation and flood control with few alternative materials for construction. In riparian and coastal environments, concrete harbours and inland canal systems are often used to address erosion or reclaim areas for human development. Even when removed (e.g., dam removal, naturalization of shorelines), concrete dust is a major aquatic pollutant. Instances do exist, however, where concrete has been used to benefit aquatic ecosystems – such as the installation of fish passage facilities at barriers or the development of fish-friendly culverts – though even then, there is a movement towards nature-like fishways that avoid the use of harmful materials like concrete. There are also opportunities to achieve conservation gains in the development of seawalls that include more natural and complex features to benefit biota and allow for essential biogeochemical processes to occur in aquatic environments. There have been several innovations in recent years that increase the permeability of concrete, however these have limited application in an aquatic context (e.g., not relevant to dam construction or erosion control but may be relevant in stormwater management systems). We provide a brief overview of the history of concrete, discuss some of the direct and indirect effects of concrete on aquatic ecosystems, and encourage planners, engineers, developers, and regulators to work collaboratively to explore alternatives to concrete which benefit aquatic ecosystems and the services they offer. The status quo of concrete being the default construction material is failing aquatic ecosystems, so we recommend that efforts are made to explore alternative materials and if concrete must be used, to increase structural complexity to benefit biodiversity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Channelization; Coastal development; Concrete; Habitat; Seawall; Shoreline alteration","Anthropocene; aquatic ecosystem; aquatic environment; biodiversity; coastal zone; conservation status; fish; flood control","Short Survey","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85085319914",NA,NA

This has negative impacts on natural resources and the environment. At the same time, food waste is undermining the global target of food security. In turn, reducing food waste can minimise the environmental effects of agriculture on climate, biodiversity, soils, water bodies and the atmosphere. All of this is reflected in the fact that food waste is subject to various legal acts of the European Union and that it is also a major subject in the new EU Farm to Fork Strategy from May 2020. Supported by an analysis of the diffuse empirical data on food waste, the purpose of this article is to analyse the current EU legislation on food waste and its reduction to answer the following research questions: How is food waste integrated into European policies? What is the impact of European legislation on food waste? Is European legislation sufficient to trigger not only food waste reduction but also comprehensive changes in the agricultural and food sector to support global climate and environmental targets as set in the Paris Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity? Which instruments are the most suitable to do so? Methodologically, a qualitative governance analysis is applied. It is found that relevant legal acts for governing food waste include circular economy and waste law, the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy as well as food law, while international environmental targets serve as an overarching measure for governance analysis. The legal analysis shows that existing legislation lacks steering effect to significantly reduce food waste. To overcome current governance problems, the article introduces economic policy instruments. It is concluded that quantity control focusing on overarching parameters such as fossil fuels or animal-derived products has not only the potential to reduce food waste by increasing food prices but can also address the multiple interlinked environmental challenges of the agricultural and food sector. © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural law; Circular economy; Common agricultural policy; Economic instruments; Environmental law; Food security; Food supply chain; Food waste; Resource conservation","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85088496931",NA,NA

As the most eco-friendly method of water restoration, phytoremediation technology still faces great challenges. To provide more theoretical support, we exploited six common submerged macrophytes and selected the most ammonium-tolerant and -sensitive species; then further explored and compared the mechanisms underlying ammonium detoxification. Our results showed the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in the ammonium-tolerant species Myriophyllum spicatum leaves performed a dose-response curve (increased 169% for NADH-dependent GDH and 103% for NADPH-dependent GDH) with the [NH4 +-N] increasing from 0 to 100 mg/L while glutamine synthetase (GS) activity slightly changed. But for the ammonium-sensitive species, Potamogeton lucens, the activity of GDH recorded no major changes, while the GS increased slightly (17%). Based on this, we conclude that the alternative pathway of GDH is more important than the pathway catalyzed by GS in determining the tolerance of submerged macrophytes to high ammonium concentration (up to 100 mg N/L). Our present study identifies submerged macrophytes that are tolerant of high concentrations of ammonium and provides mechanistic support for practical water restoration by aquatic plants. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonium assimilation; GDH; Phytoremediation; Submerged macrophytes; Water restoration","Amino acids; Bioremediation; Plants (botany); Restoration; Ammonium assimilation; Ammonium concentrations; Glutamate dehydrogenase; Myriophyllum spicatum; Phytoremediation; Phytoremediation technology; Submerged macrophytes; Water restoration; Detoxification; ammonia; dissolved oxygen; glutamate ammonia ligase; glutamate dehydrogenase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; ammonium derivative; glutamate ammonia ligase; glutamate dehydrogenase; nitrogen; ammonium; comparative study; concentration (composition); detoxification; dose-response relationship; enzyme; leaf; macrophyte; phytoremediation; aquatic flora; Article; China; chlorophyll content; controlled study; detoxification; macrophyte; Myriophyllum spicatum; nonhuman; photosynthesis; phytoremediation; plant leaf; Potamogeton lucens; priority journal; ecosystem; Potamogetonaceae; Myriophyllum spicatum; Potamogeton lucens; Ammonium Compounds; Ecosystem; Glutamate Dehydrogenase; Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase; Nitrogen; Potamogetonaceae","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85081378746",NA,NA

The performances of reused materials were assessed using turf with trays on a roof for two years in Chiba, Japan. Two types of materials, a commercial green roof substrate and cocopeat, were used as the substrate. For the drainage layers, five different materials were used: a commercial green roof drainage layer, bamboo stems and nodes, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle caps and bottoms. In addition, a sample without any drainage layer was used. The trays were prepared with the combination of these two substrates and six drainage applications. Overall, reused materials were observed to function well as commercial green roof materials. The turf in cocopeat was able to survive better than turf in commercial green roof substrate. In the drainage layers, some reused materials, such as the PET bottle caps and bamboo nodes, showed higher final plant coverage than commercial drainage layers in cocopeat.

Environmental targets are usually best quantified using the standardized, holistic method of life cycle assessment (LCA). The resulting life cycle perspective poses a major challenge to chemical engineering design because the design scope is expanded to include process, product, and supply chain. Here, we first provide a brief tutorial highlighting key elements of LCA. Methods to fill data gaps in LCA are discussed, as capturing the full life cycle is data intensive. On this basis, we review recent methods for integrating LCA into the design of chemical processes, products, and supply chains. Whereas adding LCA as a posteriori tool for decision support can be regarded as established, the integration of LCA into the design process is an active field of research. We present recent advances and derive future challenges for LCA-based design. © 2020 by Annual Reviews.

Regulatory frameworks for stressors often focus on loading rates without accounting for the physical dynamics of the receiving water body. Here, we use a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate the transport of a generic tributary-delivered anthropogenic pollutant within Lake Michigan based on the location and timing of loading. Simulating pollutant plumes from 11 rivers, and their intersections with coastal ecosystem services, reveals strong mediation of potential impacts by lake physics. Trapped pollutants accumulate in nearshore waters during spring peak flows, and become diluted by spreading offshore during the summer. The threat to coastal ecosystem services posed by pollutant loading differs sharply among rivers; high potential impact arises from the spatiotemporal coincidence of tributary input rates, lake mixing dynamics, and multiple human uses of the shoreline. Simultaneous pollution from multiple rivers yields overlapping plumes, creating a second way in which lake hydrodynamics can amplify potential impacts on coastal ecosystem services. Our simulations demonstrate that the physical dynamics of large water bodies can create a dynamic stressor landscape arising from multiple independent sources of non-point-source pollution. The design and implementation of pollution regulations rarely account for spatial and temporal complexities of load processing in receiving waters, yet the resulting variability is likely to strongly mediate impacts on society. As hydrodynamic models improve, our analytical framework could be applied to a wide range of pollutants and waterbodies to enhance the sustainable use of coastal ecosystems. © 2020 The Author(s).

Nevertheless, a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of these erosion control practices in this region is lacking. Thus, this systematic review examined the use of erosion control practices in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The key question addressed in this paper is: how soil erosion control practices have been used in the Chinese Loess Plateau? The assessment was based on (1) the categories of erosion control practice, (2) the spatial scales conducted by each erosion control practice, and (3) the cost-effectiveness of each erosion control practice. One hundred peer-reviewed papers were selected, and our results highlighted: (1) 57% of the studies, 32% of the studies, and 11% of the studies evaluated the effectiveness or impacts of ecological restoration programs, engineering techniques, and soil management techniques on soil erosion, respectively, but multiple erosion control practices evaluation received a little attention. (2) The watershed scale assessment dominated the published studies (65% of the reviewed papers), followed by plot scale assessments (35% of the reviewed papers), but the cross-scale evaluation has received little attention. (3) Soil erosion control practices have enhanced most of the soil-related ecosystem services but partially damaged water-related ecosystem services. These control practices caused trade-offs between soil erosion control and water provision and synergies between soil erosion control and water use efficiency, water regulation, and crop production. These synergy and trade-off relationships among soil erosion control practices and ecosystem services might be changed as time passes. Then, three recommendations are suggested for future studies: (1) a combination of erosion control practice assessment needs to be developed, (2) a cross-scale assessment needs to be examined, and (3) a rational balance between soil and water conservation needs to be considered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chinese loess plateau; Effectiveness; Erosion control practices; Review; Soil erosion","","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85078333901",NA,NA

The nature and intensity of these interactions can shape the impacts of organisms on their environment. Because ants and termites, with their high biomass and range of ecological functions, have considerable effects on their environment, the interaction between them is important for ecosystem processes. Although the manner in which ants and termites interact is becoming increasingly well studied, there has been no synthesis to date of the available literature. Here we review and synthesise all existing literature on ant–termite interactions. We infer that ant predation on termites is the most important, most widespread, and most studied type of interaction. Predatory ant species can regulate termite populations and subsequently slow down the decomposition of wood, litter and soil organic matter. As a consequence they also affect plant growth and distribution, nutrient cycling and nutrient availability. Although some ant species are specialised termite predators, there is probably a high level of opportunistic predation by generalist ant species, and hence their impact on ecosystem processes that termites are known to provide varies at the species level. The most fruitful future research direction will be to evaluate the impact of ant–termite predation on broader ecosystem processes. To do this it will be necessary to quantify the efficacy both of particular ant species and of ant communities as a whole in regulating termite populations in different biomes. We envisage that this work will require a combination of methods, including DNA barcoding of ant gut contents along with field observations and exclusion experiments. Such a combined approach is necessary for assessing how this interaction influences entire ecosystems. © 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society","ants; ecosystem engineer; food web; Formicidae; interaction network; predation; termites; Termitoidae","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85077363198",NA,NA

We believe that defining the vision that the circular economy is contributing to shape is key to explain its conceptual framework and activities. Drawing on the concept of fictional expectations, we uncover one of the plausible social dimensions inherent to the circular economy thinking thereby opening up a new perspective on the current debate in the circular economy literature wherein authors, by contrast, are emphasising the lack of an explicit social dimension. Fictional expectations are introduced to refer to those imaginaries of the future that can catalyse social action in the present and counteract societal addictions, in which modern society seems to be trapped. We show how a circular economy inspired vision can be instrumental to the emergence of a fictional expectation that can provide therapies to the current societal addiction of wasteful production and consumption systems. This philosophical background allows us to provide, in conclusion, a new conceptualisation of the circular economy as a cognitive framework instrumental to the emergence of a future imaginary. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Circular economy; Fictional expectations; Societal addictions; Vision","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85079149859",NA,NA

It is important to quantify these impacts in economic terms, so as to be able to provide evidence-based support for an appropriate policy response. We review the South African literature on the impacts of marine plastic debris on ecosystem services and on the economy, in order to identify relevant knowledge gaps. The gaps are found to be significant. Some research has been conducted in terms of impacts relating to recreation, aesthetics and tourism and the costs of beach and harbour clean-ups. However, there is a significant lack of research regarding impacts on ecosystem services relating to fisheries and aquaculture, heritage, habitat provision, biodiversity, and nutrient cycles. There is also a significant lack of research regarding direct economic impacts on the transport/shipping and fisheries industries, indirect economic impacts (such as costs associated with health-related impacts), and non-market costs (e.g. impacts on scenic, cultural and spiritual values). More research is needed in South Africa to address these gaps, in order to inform policy aimed at addressing plastic waste and marine plastic debris. Significance: • This review highlights the knowledge gaps in terms of the impacts of marine plastics on ecosystem services and on the economy in South Africa, which are important to understand in order to be able to direct funding for future research in this domain. Without better knowledge of the economic impacts of marine plastic debris, it is difficult to assess the costs of inaction, and therefore to inform an appropriate policy response for tackling the problem of marine plastic debris. © 2020.

In radioecology, size limitations are important as large experimental volumes involve problems with waste (radionuclides), or shielding, absorption and available space in gamma fields (often within a climate chamber). We have therefore performed a literature review (ISI Web of Science, n = 406) of the design and properties of multispecies effect studies <100 L in size and with three or more mentioned taxa in other research fields to assess their suitability to radioecology. Studies with more mentioned taxa assess structural ecosystem parameters more often than studies with fewer mentioned taxa, while the opposite trend is seen for indirect effects/interactions. Studies of indirect effects benefit from more replicates and longer experiments. Almost all studies assess some ecosystem level parameter but only a quarter take a holistic approach assessing both structural and functional as well as indirect effects. We find that most cosms are custom-made systems, rather than standardised designs. Unmanipulated cosms consist of excised portions of the natural environment with a higher number of mentioned taxa, high ecological complexity and high realism, but have a relatively low replicability. In contrast, standardised cosms with fewer mentioned taxa have less ecological complexity but much higher replicability. This literature review shows that smaller cosm sizes have similar ecological complexity (e.g. number of taxa and trophic levels) and experimental duration as larger sized cosms, allowing for ecologically-relevant investigations, despite their small size. We encourage multispecies radioecology studies, preferably with environmental relevant doses and sufficient detail on dosimetry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ecosystem approach; indirect effects; microcosm; Multispecies experiment design; radioecology","Environmental engineering; Pollution; Ecosystem approach; Experiment design; Indirect effects; microcosm; Radioecology; Ecosystems; complexity; ecosystem; experimental design; literature review; mesocosm; microcosm; radioactivity; radionuclide; controlled study; dosimetry; human; microcosm; review; structure activity relation; systematic review; trophic level; Web of Science","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85076569212",NA,NA

The MPB are essential components of soft-sediment systems, but are often overlooked when assessing coastal ecosystem functionality and service delivery. The MPB are involved in several complex interactions and feedback that underpin the delivery of vital ecosystem services. MPB profoundly influence the flow and cycling of carbon and nutrients, such as nitrogen, directly and indirectly underpinning highly productive shallow water marine food webs. The MPB can also stabilize sediments through the formation of biofilms, and significantly improve water quality by mediating the benthic–pelagic coupling of nutrients, sediment and pollutants. The functional role of the MPB is compromised by increasing anthropogenic pressures such as nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, herbicides and emerging contaminants such as microplastic pollution. However, MPB are extremely good at buffering the effects of these land-sourced stressors at the interface between land and sea. Synthesis. Society often appreciates the final provisioning of goods and services from our coastal marine environments. However, provisioning services are only possible due to the multitude of supporting and regulating services that underpin them. Microphytobenthos (MPB) are central to benthic ecological networks, and contribute to ecosystem service delivery through various pathways. Understanding the critical role of MPB in complex networks is therefore essential to appreciate their importance in ecosystem function and service delivery into the future. © 2019 British Ecological Society","benthic microalgae; ecosystem services; estuarine systems; microphytobenthos; service delivery; soft-sediment ecology","anthropogenic effect; benthic-pelagic coupling; coastal zone; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; food web; functional role; marine environment; nutrient cycling; photic zone; phytobenthos; plastic; shallow water; water quality","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85077061764",NA,NA

The Europe-wide VinylPlus® voluntary commitment includes a challenge to make progress toward sustainable use of additives. Additive Sustainability Footprint (ASF) was developed to assess sustainable use of additives across the whole societal life cycles of finished PVC articles, taking a risk-based approach rather than simplistic hazard assessment. ASF addresses impacts across six life cycle assessment (LCA) stages established by ISO Standard 14040, using the four System Conditions (sustainability principles) developed by The Natural Step (TNS) covering social as well as environmental factors. For each LCA stage/System Condition combination, seven generically similar questions cover negative impacts (many covered by existing tools and regulations) but also the additive's positive contributions to the sustainability of finished articles. Positive contributions include ethical sourcing, longevity of service life, low maintenance inputs, and recyclability. Answers to questions determine a score, which can be combined across the life cycle and with other additives. Testing on a generic EU PVC window profile supported ASF development and demonstrated applicability and potential benefits including use for sensitivity analysis of alternative additives from different geopolitical regions or from recycled as opposed to virgin sources.

In this study, we quantified the presence of microparticles in wild populations of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from the Salish Sea, Washington State. Examination under a dissecting microscope revealed 63% of oysters contained microparticles (~1.75 microparticles per oyster) and microfibers were the dominant type of particles. Using Raman microspectroscopy (RMS) and Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (μ-FTIR) we found that only ~2% of these microparticles were synthetic and included polymers such as polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(bisphenol A carbonate), rayon, and polyacrylate. It is important to note that of the 447 microparticles analyzed with RMS, 41% showed fluorescence interference, impeding the determination of their identification. The remaining microparticles were cellulose derivatives, shell fragments, biological or proteinaceous material, salts, minerals, and gypsum. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy equipped with a diamond attenuated total reflectance accessory (ATR-FTIR) showed the presence of sorbitan derivatives in all samples examined (n = 213). These findings provide the first baseline for microplastic and other particles in oysters from the west coast of the United States integrating results from ATR-FTIR, μ-FTIR, and RMS, in addition to visual sorting. These results suggest there is low retention of plastic particles in Pacific oysters from the Salish Sea, but further research is needed to determine the composition of microparticles with fluorescence interference. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crassostrea gigas; FTIR; Polymers; Raman microspectroscopy; Shellfish; Sorbitan","Fluorescence; Marine pollution; Microoptics; Microplastic; Molluscs; Polymers; Polypropylenes; Screening; Shellfish; Supersaturation; Attenuated total reflectance; Crassostrea gigas; Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy; FTIR; Poly(bisphenol A carbonate); Proteinaceous materials; Raman microspectroscopy; Sorbitan; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; biomaterial; calcium sulfate; carbonic acid; cellulose derivative; microplastic; mineral; poly(bisphenol A carbonic acid); polyacrylic acid; polyethylene; polymer; polypropylene; polystyrene; rayon; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; FTIR spectroscopy; marine pollution; particulate matter; plastic waste; polymer; quantitative analysis; Raman spectroscopy; shellfish; animal shell; animal tissue; Article; attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; controlled study; Crassostrea gigas; estuary; Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; plastic industry; priority journal; Raman microspectroscopy; Raman spectrometry; United States; animal; Crassostrea; ecosystem; Washington; Cellulose Derivatives; Fluorescence; Interference; Particles; Plastics; Polymers; Screening; Supersaturation; Pacific Ocean; Salish Sea; United States; Washington [United States]; Crassostrea gigas; Ostreidae; Animals; Crassostrea; Ecosystem; Microplastics; United States; Washington","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85078884956",NA,NA

These effects include those on human health, air quality, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, and materials used in construction and other services. The present update evaluates further evidence of the consequences of human activity on climate change that are altering the exposure of organisms and ecosystems to UV radiation. This in turn reveals the interactive effects of many climate change factors with UV radiation that have implications for the atmosphere, feedbacks, contaminant fate and transport, organismal responses, and many outdoor materials including plastics, wood, and fabrics. The universal ratification of the Montreal Protocol, signed by 197 countries, has led to the regulation and phase-out of chemicals that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. Although this treaty has had unprecedented success in protecting the ozone layer, and hence all life on Earth from damaging UV radiation, it is also making a substantial contribution to reducing climate warming because many of the chemicals under this treaty are greenhouse gases. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.","","Air quality; Aquatic ecosystems; Biogeochemistry; Greenhouse gases; Ozone; Ozone layer; Radiation effects; Ultraviolet radiation; Biogeochemical cycle; Fate and transport; Interactive effect; Montreal Protocols; Stratospheric ozone; Stratospheric ozone depletion; Stratospheric ozone layers; United Nations Environment Programme; Climate change; climate change; environmental health; human; ozone layer; ultraviolet radiation; United Nations; Climate Change; Environmental Health; Humans; Microplastics; Stratospheric Ozone; Ultraviolet Rays; United Nations","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85084962570",NA,NA

The CE is an alternative to the current ""take, make, waste” extractive industrial model and offers a practical solution to address global and local environmental challenges, such as resource depletion, marine plastic pollution, and for staying within planetary system boundaries. Although the CE and related concepts such as cradle to cradle provide a most promising alternative to the traditional linear economy model and its impacts on the planets eco-systems, some of the CE key elements have raised debate both in the academic community and among policy makers. One of the debates concerns the missing social or human dimensions of the CE. Likewise, the HD approach lacks considerations of environmental sustainability. Drawing on both academic and grey literature and the authorsö research observations and professional experiences in the fields of promoting the CE and international development cooperation for HD, we attempt to develop an integrative conceptual framework of the CE and HD. This framework includes social-economic elements of the transformation from linear to circular economic models, combined with HD from the social sciences and development studies. We thereby complement the technological-material focused CE model that is primarily based on principles of industrial ecology and engineering. We utilize the existing ‘circular humansphereö concept to articulate the incorporation of HD into the discussion of CE. By bringing in explicit links with HD, we pursue a double aim: First, to raise awareness and understanding among the CE research community of the missing human dimension in current CE discourse, and second, to familiarise the international development community with the approaches of CE. This will advance the options for adopting CE practices in international development programmes and for the process of implementing the social SDGs concerning HD such as SDG 1, 3, 4, 5, and 10. Finally, we hope that this CE and HD framework can contribute to the resolution of environmental and developmental issues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Human development; SDGs","Economics; Linear transformations; Marine pollution; Mathematical transformations; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Conceptual frameworks; Environmental challenges; Environmental sustainability; Human development; International development; Professional experiences; SDGs; Economic and social effects; economics; environmental issue; sustainability; sustainable development; article; astronomy; awareness; conceptual framework; drawing; ecology; economic model; environmental sustainability; grey literature; human; human development; human experiment; sociology","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85077931595",NA,NA

This decline represents a major threat to the health and wellbeing of human populations worldwide. Environmental change, particularly climate change, is already having and will increasingly have an impact on the incidence and distribution of kidney diseases. Increases in extreme weather events owing to climate change are likely to have a destabilizing effect on the provision of care to patients with kidney disease. Ironically, health care is part of the problem, contributing substantially to resource depletion and greenhouse gas emissions. Among medical therapies, the environmental impact of dialysis seems to be particularly high, suggesting that the nephrology community has an important role to play in exploring environmentally responsible health-care practices. There is a need for increased monitoring of resource usage and waste generation by kidney care facilities. Opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of haemodialysis include capturing and reusing reverse osmosis reject water, utilizing renewable energy, improving waste management and potentially reducing dialysate flow rates. In peritoneal dialysis, consideration should be given to improving packaging materials and point-of-care dialysate generation. © 2020, Crown.","","sorbent; carbon footprint; climate change; clinical effectiveness; clinical practice; dialysate level; environmental factor; environmental health; environmental impact; environmental protection; flow rate; health care practice; hemodialysis; human; incidence; kidney disease; kidney transplantation; nephrology; peritoneal dialysis; physical well-being; priority journal; program sustainability; recycling; renewable energy; reverse osmosis; Review; risk factor; risk reduction; waste water; waste water management; waste water recycling; water management; climate change; kidney disease; waste management; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Humans; Kidney Diseases; Nephrology; Waste Management","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85079461334",NA,NA

However, it is not well understood how carbon dynamics in these ecosystems respond to grazing and whether a response differs among meadows or locations. We measured seagrass ecosystem metabolism in grazed and ungrazed areas of Thalassia testudinum meadows with established green turtle foraging areas across the Greater Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. We sampled meadows from five locations that differed in seagrass and environmental characteristics. Established meadows of the invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea were also present at two of these locations, and we measured ecosystem metabolism in these meadows for comparison to grazed and ungrazed areas of the native T. testudinum. Across all individual sites, rates of net ecosystem production (NEP) ranged from 56% to 96% lower in grazed areas than ungrazed areas of T. testudinum meadows. Rates of NEP were also strongly, positively correlated with above-ground seagrass biomass across sites. While metabolic carbon capture rates were lower in grazed areas, heterotrophic respiration was not stimulated, and grazing therefore did not result in significant metabolic remineralization of carbon in these meadows. NEP in H. stipulacea meadows was similar to rates in T. testudinum meadows at all three sites, suggesting that metabolic carbon capture may remain similar in Caribbean meadows where this invasive seagrass is replacing native species. Synthesis. Our results show that there is a consistent response in metabolic carbon dynamics to green turtle grazing in T. testudinum meadows across the Greater Caribbean region. An increase in grazing will not likely stimulate remineralization of carbon as these important habitats are returned to a natural grazed state. © 2019 The Authors.

Although there are numerous mitigation practices that control nitrate leaching, an integrated assessment of these measures is lacking. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to integrate the assessment of strategies for controlling nitrate leaching from vegetable systems in China. The main strategies included improved N fertilizer management (INFM), reduced water management (RWM), comprehensive regulation of N fertilizer and water management (CFWM), and catch crops (CCs). Each mitigation measure decreased nitrate leaching significantly and did not reduce vegetable yields. CFWM reduced nitrate leaching the most at 41% on average, followed by CCs, RWM, and INFM (35%, 24%, and 22%, respectively). The nitrate leaching scaled yields (NLSY, defined as yield divided by the quantity of nitrate leaching) were significantly increased by 87%, 44%, 32%, and 27% for CFWM, CCs, INFM, and RWM, respectively. The efficacies of the strategies were dependent on soil properties. CFWM, INFM, and RWM were more effective in soils with low pH and coarse texture than in other soils. In conclusion, the risk of nitrate leaching from vegetable production systems is high, and INFM and CFWM are suggested to decrease nitrate leaching from vegetable production. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Meta-analysis; Mitigation strategies; Nitrate leaching; Vegetable production","agricultural management; crop production; crop yield; fertilizer application; leaching; meta-analysis; nitrate; soil property; vegetable; China; fertilizer; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; agriculture; China; soil; vegetable; Agriculture; China; Fertilizers; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Soil; Vegetables","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85082835854",NA,NA

A firm's ability to identify the production and export of marine-related products can be viewed as an essential part of a long-term strategy aimed at supporting marine economic development. We identify a list of marine-related products that have the greatest growth potential for 107 Chinese firms and their related industries and draw a conceptual model of marine-related products at the country and firm levels using the concepts of product space and product proximity, which provides a new policy analysis tool for sustainable marine development. To achieve our goals, we conduct a regression analysis of this hypothesis. We build an improved product space for China and the 107 firms in 2011 and 2012 and calculate the maximum proximity of each marine-related product to products with high revealed comparative advantage (RCA) values for each firm. The results show that the marine-related products with the greatest proximity to the products with high RCA values exhibited the greatest growth.

Five sets of lab-scale CWs were assembled with mixtures of five waste solids and operated to evaluate the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrients from urban and industrial-types of wastewater. The adaptation and growth of the macrophyte Phragmites australis in the mixed-filler CWs was also monitored. Although all evaluated waste solids showed to be acceptable substrates for macrophyte development and wastewater treatment, CWs assembled with mixtures of limestone waste and coal slag showed the best plant growth indicators and wastewater treatment efficiencies. The CWs assembled with mixtures of limestone waste and clay brick fragments or cork granulates showed to be suitable alternatives. With exception for CWs filled with mixtures of limestone and snail shells, pollutant removal efficiencies up to 95%, 86% and 83% were obtained respectively for COD, total phosphorous and total nitrogen, depending on the type of wastewater and mode of operation. Removal efficiencies were not significantly affected by increased hydraulic rate. The CWs can be operated to a hydraulic loading rate of 0.056 m/d, which corresponds to a retention time of 1.5 days. The valorisation of solid waste as a filler can contribute to CWs closely participating in the creation of circular flows for the reuse of waste solids. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coal slag; Cork granulates; Limestone waste; Waste recovery; Wastewater","Chemical oxygen demand; Efficiency; Fillers; Lime; Limestone; Metal recovery; Mixtures; Nitrogen removal; Plant life extension; Reclamation; Slags; Solid wastes; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Constructed wetlands (CWs); Cork granulates; Hydraulic loading rates; Phragmites australis; Pollutant removal efficiency; Removal efficiencies; Waste recoveries; Wastewater treatment efficiencies; Waste treatment","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85077499633",NA,NA

Much of the focus has been on the marine environment, with little information on the hazard posed by debris accumulating on beaches and adjacent vegetated areas. Here we investigate the potential for beach debris to disrupt terrestrial species and ecosystems on two remote islands. The significant quantities of debris on the beaches, and throughout the coastal vegetation, create a significant barrier which strawberry hermit crabs (Coenobita perlatus) encounter during their daily activities. Around 61,000 (2.447 crabs/m2) and 508,000 crabs (1.117 crabs/m2) are estimated to become entrapped in debris and die each year on Henderson Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, respectively. Globally, there is an urgent need to establish a clear link between debris interactions and population persistence, as loss of biodiversity contributes to ecosystem degradation.

However, due to mismanagement of solid waste, discharges of wastewaters and other land and marine activities, they can be polluted by microplastics. This research aimed to quantify and classify the microplastics found in Mexican beaches. Samples were taken in 33 beaches, along the five marine regions of the country, following a systematic method that allows comparison of results. Microplastics concentration varied from 31.7–545.8 M P/m2, with high variance coefficients (28.7–122.3 %). The Gulf of California was the region that showed a higher mean concentration. Presence of microplastics was higher in urban-overdeveloped beaches and increased with the occurrence of extreme weather events. Prevention of pollution of beaches by microplastics would allow to preserve the natural resources of the country, as well as to recover valuable materials that can be reinserted in production cycles. © 2019","Caribbean Sea; Gulf of California; Gulf of Mexico; Marine waste; Microplastic pollution","Beaches; Economics; Marine pollution; Natural resources; Caribbean Sea; Environmental services; Extreme weather events; Gulf of California; Gulf of Mexico; Marine waste; Mean concentrations; Systematic method; Microplastic; coastal zone; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; environmental management; marine pollution; plastic waste; solid waste; article; Caribbean Sea; Gulf of California; Gulf of Mexico; intermethod comparison; natural resource; seashore; weather; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Sea; Gulf of California; Gulf of Mexico; Pacific Ocean","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85077715278",NA,NA

In this work, we report the results of processing reclaimed plastic wastes from unsanitary landfill site in Kuwait by using a bench scale continuous auger pyrolysis system. The plastic feedstock was characterised. After a simple thermal densification process, the material was fed to the pyrolysis system at 500 ◦C. The pyro-oil and wax products were collected and characterised. The process mass balance was developed on dry basis, and the yields of pyro-oil, light wax, heavy wax and gases were 5.5, 23.8, 69.4 and 1.3 wt%, respectively. The findings have indicated that the reclamation of plastic waste from landfill was feasible in terms of the product distribution and characteristics. Further liquid analysis confirmed that the liquid products contained fractions that are comparable to petrol and diesel fuels. The wax products are viable and have potential application as coating, covering and lubrication. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In the context of global change, modifications in winter conditions may disrupt the seasonal phenology patterns of organisms, modify the synchrony of closely interacting species and lead to unpredictable outcomes at different ecological scales. 2. Parasites are present in almost every food web and their interactions with hosts greatly contribute to ecosystem functioning. Among upper trophic levels of terrestrial ecosystems, insect parasitoids are key components in terms of functioning and species richness. Parasitoids respond to climate change in similar ways to other insects, but their close relationship with their hosts and their particular life cycle – alternating between parasitic and free-living forms – make them special cases. 3. This article reviews of the mechanisms likely to undergo plastic or evolutionary adjustments when exposed to climate change that could modify insect seasonal strategies. Different scenarios are then proposed for the evolution of parasitoid insect seasonal ecology by exploring three anticipated outcomes of climate change: (i) decreased severity of winter cold; (ii) decreased winter duration; and (iii) increased extreme seasonal climatic events and environmental stochasticity. 4. The capacities of insects to adapt to new environmental conditions, either through plasticity or genetic evolution, are highlighted. They may reduce diapause expression, adapt to changing cues to initiate or terminate diapause, increase voltinism, or develop overwintering bet-hedging strategies, but parasitoids' responses will be highly constrained by those of their hosts. 5. Changes in the seasonal ecology of parasitoids may have consequences on host–parasitoid synchrony and population cycles, food-web functioning, and ecosystem services such as biological pest control. © 2019 The Royal Entomological Society","Climatic scenarios; food webs; host–parasitoid relationships; insect seasonality; overwintering strategies; phenology","bet-hedging; climate change; evolutionary biology; food web; global change; host-parasitoid interaction; overwintering; phenology; seasonality; species richness; Hexapoda","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85070778820",NA,NA

Given the increasing awareness about environmental litter, many communities have banned SUPBs in the recent past. Here we explore an emerging economy to document the rise and demise of SUPBs in society. Through a review of scientific and grey literature (including governmental documents and media coverage) we reconstruct the timeline of SUPBs in Chile, including the development of the plastic industry and retail business within Chile, the introduction, spread and finally the demise of SUPBs. Focused on the demise phase, we document the creation and succession of municipal ordinances to reduce SUPBs in local commerce, and the development of a national law to regulate the use of SUPBs. In order to document the involvement of the general public during the demise phase, we also examined current behavior and behavioral intentions of people in (i) a local project introducing reusable cloth bags to reduce the use of SUPBs, and (ii) a consumer survey about public perception of SUPBs and their use. Plastic bags were introduced in Chile in the 1970s, then spread with the emergence of supermarkets and retail stores in the 1980s and 1990s, and were widely used in commerce by the turn of the century. During the first decade of the 21st century the first scientific studies reported large amounts of plastic litter and high proportions of single-use plastics in coastal environments, public awareness grew, and numerous initiatives aiming to reduce consumption and littering of plastics developed. The first municipal ban of SUPBs in 2013 was emulated during the following five years by 62 other Chilean municipalities and in 2018 translated into a national law, which was highly approved and supported by the population. We conclude that the ban of SUBPs in Chile was facilitated by a broad concern among the general public, which led to a bottom-up movement culminating in the national government taking stakes in the issue. Finally, we argue that this can only be a first step that must be followed by further actions to abolish single-use products in order to effectively protect the environment and in particular the world's oceans. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Marine litter; Pro-environmental behavior; Socio-economic factors; Waste management; Willingness to engage","Consumer behavior; Elastomers; Plastic containers; Waste management; Behavioral intention; Coastal environments; Marine litter; National governments; Natural environments; Pro-environmental behaviors; Socio-economic factor; Willingness to engage; Retail stores; bottom-up approach; coastal zone; environmental protection; marine environment; plastic; supermarket; Chile","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85076997665",NA,NA

The influence of the properties and method of use of plastic materials used to cover soils, such as the number and thickness of layers, and colour of the material, significantly alters soil thermal-physical properties. These effects can be managed and modified to increase solarisation efficiency by achieving a decrease in vapour movement between the soil surface and the atmosphere. Also, soil solarisation establishes microclimates that increase the effectiveness of fertilisers, thus modifying the soil thermal-physical properties. However, there is a lack of complete and general overview of this widely used technology. This paper presents a comprehensive review of soil solarisation technology and describes the impacts it has on soil thermal-physical properties when combined with different soil treatments. It is well-known that the efficiency of solarisation technology increases with temperature. However, we describe that the heat transfer effectivity depends on several different soil thermal-physical properties such as the soil thermal flux, conductivity, diffusivity, soil volumetric heat capacity, and soil temperature. Other soil physical properties such as soil texture, soil bulk density, soil porosity, and soil volumetric moisture content have contributions to make. Moreover, there are several external factors which significantly modify the effectiveness of heat transfer under different solarisation conditions, particularly the weather conditions, the type of tillage management, properties of plastics used and moisture content. We conclude that more research needs to be done: (i) to quantify the degree to which soil thermal-physical properties affect soil solarisation technology, and (ii) to assess the impact of soil technology on crop productivity and quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","External factors; Fertiliser; Soil mulches; Soil thermal-physical properties; Solarisation technology; Tillage management","Crops; Efficiency; Fertilizers; Heat transfer; Moisture; Moisture determination; Porosity; Productivity; Specific heat; Textures; External factors; Plastic materials; Soil bulk density; Soil physical property; Thermal-physical property; Tillage management; Volumetric heat capacity; Volumetric moisture content; Soils; crop production; fertilizer application; heat transfer; moisture content; mulch; physical analysis; plastic; soil solarization; thermochemistry; tillage","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85077776357",NA,NA

Bioprocessing of waste in municipal landfills emanates from substrate metabolism and co-metabolism by several syntrophic microorganisms, resulting in partial transformation of complex substrates into simpler polymeric compounds and complete mineralisation into inorganic salts, water and gases including the biofuel gas methane. The substrate decomposition is characterised by evolution and interactions of different bacterial, archaeal and fungal groups due to prevailing biotic and abiotic conditions in the landfills, allowing for hydrolytic, fermentative, acetogenic and methanogenic processes to occur. Application of metagenomics studies based on high throughput Next Generation Sequencing technique has advanced research on profiling of the microbial communities in municipal solid waste landfills. However, functional diversity and bioprocess dynamics, as well as key factors influencing the in situ bioprocesses involved in landfill waste degradation; the very elements that are key in determining the efficiency of municipal landfills as tools of waste management, remain ambiguous. Such gaps also hinder progressive understanding of fundamentals that underlie technology development based on waste biodegradation, and exploration of municipal waste as a bioresource. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Bioprocesses; Functional diversity; Microbial ecology; Municipal solid waste landfills; Waste degradation","Biodegradation; Dynamics; Land fill; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Petroleum prospecting; Substrates; Bioprocesses; Functional diversity; Microbial ecology; Municipal solid waste landfills; Waste degradation; Municipal solid waste; bacterium; biodegradation; biofuel; fungus; landfill; metabolism; microbial activity; microbiology; municipal solid waste; waste management; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); bioremediation; ecosystem; solid waste; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; Biodegradation, Environmental; Ecosystem; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Disposal Facilities","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85073986812",NA,NA

However, its potential contribution to climate change adaptation is unclear. Adaptation has become increasingly urgent in a continuously changing climate, especially in developing countries, which are projected to bear the brunt of climate-change-related damages. On the basis of a brief review of climate change impacts and adaptation literature, we suggest that IE can play an important role in the following two aspects. First, with the emphasis on a systems perspective, IE can help us determine how climate change interacts with our socio-economic system and how the interactions may aggravate (or moderate) its direct impacts or whether they may shift burden to other environmental impacts. Second, IE methodologies can help us quantify the direct and indirect environmental impacts of adaptation activities, identify mitigation opportunities, and achieve sustainable adaptation. Further, we find that substantial investment is needed to increase the resilience of infrastructure (e.g., transport, energy, and water supply) and agriculture in developing countries. Because these sectors are also the main drivers of environmental degradation, how to achieve sustainable climate-resilient infrastructure and agriculture in developing countries deserves special attention in future IE studies. Overall, IE thinking and methodologies have great potential to contribute to climate change adaptation research and policy questions, and exploring this growing field will, in turn, inspire IE development. © 2020 by Yale University","climate change adaptation; climate resilience; climate-smart agriculture; life cycle assessment (LCA); low-carbon infrastructure; material flow analysis","Agriculture; Developing countries; Economics; Environmental impact; Industrial research; Investments; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Water supply; Climate change adaptation; climate resilience; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low carbon; Material flow analysis; Smart agricultures; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; developing world; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental impact; industrial ecology; input-output analysis; life cycle analysis; material flow analysis","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85078946609",NA,NA

Microplastics may interact with soil physicochemical properties and organisms and negatively affect plant growth. To alleviate environmental plastic pollution, synthetic and biobased biodegradable polymers are replacing nonbiodegradable polymers, but their biodegradation rate in the field is frequently lower than that estimated from standardized biodegradation testing. Plastic polymer biodegradation is a multistep process that involves plastic deterioration, microbial colonization, production of polymer-degrading exoenzymes, and mineralization. However, these physicochemical and biological processes are not always efficient because of unfavorable environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, soil moisture). We propose to use earthworms to increase the biodegradable polymer biodegradation rate by creating optimal habitats for microbial proliferation. Earthworm-induced processes that lead to soil alteration (bioturbation) and solid organic wastes decomposition (vermicomposting) are described to understand how earthworms may favor biodegradable plastic mineralization. Therefore, we suggest two practical sustainable bioengineering strategies: (1) enhancing bioturbation by inoculating agricultural soils with soil-dwelling earthworms, which is viable for horticulture where using biodegradable mulching films increases plastic debris in the soil and (2) vermicomposting with blended biodegradable plastic debris and solid organic wastes, which is complementary to industrial or home composting of single-use biodegradable plastics. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Earthworms; Enhanced bioturbation; Microplastics; Mulch films; Plastic biodegradation; Vermitechnology","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biodegradation; Debris; Deterioration; Elastomers; Microplastic; Mineralogy; Physicochemical properties; Plant life extension; Pollution; Soil moisture; Bioturbation; Earthworms; Microplastics; Mulch films; Vermitechnology; Biodegradable polymers","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85082746436",NA,NA

An increasing amount of countries manage municipal solid waste through EPR systems to fight environmental pollution. It is of great significance to explore the EPR systems that are suitable for China's situation, building on foreign advanced experiences. This paper presents a tripartite game model to explore the strategy selection of producers, recyclers, and the government, as well as the mechanisms of implementation of an EPR system in China, and its influencing factors. The results demonstrate that: (i) eight evolutionary stable strategies emerge in the implementation of the EPR system. (ii) the strategy selection of producers largely depends on the difference between payoffs and costs related to the EPR system. (iii) contract signature is a helpful way to limit the “free-riding” behavior of stakeholders. (iv) producers can cooperate with multiple recyclers to disperse the risk caused by their opportunity cost. All these factors need to be considered in the implementation of EPR regulation, and to construct a complete system of waste recycling and utilization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Extended producer responsibility (EPR); Simulation analysis; Stakeholder; Tripartite evolutionary game","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Contract signature; Environmental pollutions; Evolutionary games; Evolutionary stable strategies; Extended producer responsibility; Simulation analysis; Stakeholder; Strategy selection; Municipal solid waste","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85076247033",NA,NA

In the mangroves of Southern China, the systematic evaluation of the distribution, characteristics and ecological risks of MPs is lacking. In this study, surface sediments (0–5 cm depth) were collected from six representative mangroves in China to explore MP contamination and its associated ecological risk. Based on the results, MP concentrations of MPs in mangrove sediments were as follows: FT (2249 ± 747 items/kg), ZJ (736 ± 269 items/kg), DF (649 ± 443 items/kg), DZG (431 ± 170 items/kg), YX (424 ± 127 items/kg), and FCG (227 ± 173 items/kg). The higher MP concentration in the Futian mangrove was mainly related to inputs from the Pearl River, the third largest river in China. The predominant shape, colour, and size of MPs were fibrous, white-transparent, and 500–5000 μm, respectively. The main MP polymer types were polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene. Degradation artefacts were present on surface of MPs as well as metallic and non-metallic elements. MPs concentration in mangrove sediments increased with increasing social-economic development of surrounding districts, which indicated the clear influence of anthropogenic activity on MP pollution in these mangroves. Furthermore, total organic carbon (TOC) and silt content were positively associated with MPs (P &lt; 0.01), indicating a facilitatory role in deposition of MPs in mangroves. Based on a comprehensive evaluation using the potential ecological risk factor (Ei), potential ecological risk (RI), polymer risk index (H) and pollution load index (PLI), MPs were found to present ecological risks in these mangroves, with the highest risk occurring in the Futian mangrove. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; Ecological risk; Impact factor; Mangroves; Microplastics","Ecosystems; Microplastic; Offshore oil well production; Organic carbon; Plastic products; Polypropylenes; Sediments; China; Ecological risks; Impact factor; Mangroves; Microplastics; River pollution; organic carbon; plastic; polyethylene; polypropylene; polystyrene; ecological impact; estuarine ecosystem; mangrove; plastic waste; polymer; spatial distribution; Article; Avicennia marina; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; degradation; economic development; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; geographic distribution; human activities; mangrove; nonhuman; pollution and pollution related phenomena; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; risk assessment; risk factor; river; sand; scanning electron microscopy; seashore; sediment; socioeconomics; stereomicroscopy; water contamination; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; water pollutant; China; Rhizophoraceae; China; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Microplastics; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85075907131",NA,NA

Bioenergy produced per hectare reflected yields: Miscanthus &gt; poplar &gt; switchgrass &gt; native grasses ≈ maize stover (residue) &gt; restored prairie ≈ early successional.

In Svalbard, for example, plastics are found on the shorelines, in the water column, on the ocean floor and in the ice. Organisms have been observed to be entangled in nets and ingestion of plastics has been documented in a range of organisms. Notably almost all Arctic bird species have been found to have ingested plastic, with Northern fulmars being particularly affected, with 89 % of samples recorded as having ingested plastic. Identification and valuation of ecosystem services affected by marine plastic pollution can provide input for decision makers in evaluating and comparing management policies concerning this unique environment. This study employs the contingent valuation method (CVM) for eliciting the willingness to pay (WTP) of Norwegian households for reducing marine plastic pollution around the archipelago of Svalbard. An Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model (ICLV) is employed to explore attitudinal determinants of WTP. We find an average WTP for an initiative to reduce marine plastics of NOK 5,485 (USD 642) per household per year. The ICLV results reveal that people who are relatively more concerned about marine plastic pollution and who deem the proposed initiative effective are willing to pay more (up to 85 % and 50 %, respectively).

We conducted 6 focus groups (2016–17) involving participants with no obvious knowledge of microplastics and some with special interest. Most people were unaware of microplastics though environmentally conscious participants had heard of microbeads due to media reporting concerning regulation. Few made connections between their personal use of plastics and ocean pollution.

The broad concepts of productivity-oriented ‘bio-economy’ and conservation-oriented ‘eco-economy’ were proposed to transform exploitative land-based economies. Taking cases in Borneo as core examples, this paper explores 10 transformative strategies for sustainability: boosting upstream productivity of cash crops, activating under-utilised low carbon (ULC) land for production, upgrading and diversifying downstream activities, branding for more values (industrial), establishing new domestic demand for bio-resources, creating values for carbon and ecosystem services, enhancing agro-ecological resilience, establishing eco-based tertiary sectors, branding for more values (smallholders), and encouraging self-sufficient farming. Generally, utility-based development strategies with wealth creation as the centre of policymaking are inadequate to repair the previous environmental damage. Likewise, strategies that prioritise restoration have shown a limited contribution to economic growth as observed in the case of Borneo. The interconnected nature of economic productivity and conservation means that no single strategy is a perfect solution but a combination of them may produce a better outcome. While integrated landscape analysis that combines land-use models and economic analyses can facilitate understanding of the systems, in-depth area studies are necessary to capture the more subtle ‘human factors’ like socio-political dynamics. The existence of multiple stakeholders with different interests and values means that an ‘optimal’ combination would be a result of political negotiations rather than scientific investigations. To design and also effectively execute the strategies, communication, collaboration and co-production of knowledge between scientific communities and various stakeholders is imperative. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-economy; Borneo; Eco-economy; Land-use; Palm oil; Transformation","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85076250536",NA,NA

The model outputs the combination of input usage in a tomato cropping system, which leads to the highest economic output and the least environmental impact. Methods: The LCA inventory was created using data from 114 open-field tomato farms in the Alborz Province of Iran during one growing period in 2015. Among all management components, the main focus was on irrigation management systems. The optimization problem was designed by integrating three indicators: carbon footprint (CF), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and energy use efficiency (EUE) as the objective of field tomato production. The functional unit was 1 kg of tomato aligned with the system boundary of the cradle to market life cycle. Three artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied to model relationships between the inputs and three indices (CF, BCR, and EUE) as the objective functions. Multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) were used to minimize the CF and maximize the BCR and EUE indicators. The abovementioned aims have been pursued by developing codes in MATLAB software. Results and discussion: CF, BCR, and EUE were calculated to be 0.26 kg CO2−eq (kg tomato)−1, 1.8, and 0.5, respectively. MOGA results envisage the possibility of an increase of 86% and 50% in the EUE and BCR and a 43% reduction in the CF of tomato production systems. Moreover, EUE and BCR increased by 83% and 49%, and CF was reduced by 39% from the optimum results obtained from the MOPSO algorithm. It was revealed that in order to optimize field tomato production with the target objectives of this study, a large additional use for irrigation pipes, plastic, and machinery in comparison to current situation is required, while a large reduction of biocide, chemical fertilizer, and electricity consumption is indispensable. Conclusions: According to the results of our study, it was concluded that the optimal solutions require a modernization of irrigation systems and a decrease in the consumption of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The implementation of management options for such solutions is discussed. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial neural networks; Benefit-cost ratio; Carbon footprint; Energy use efficiency; Field tomato; Iran; Life cycle assessment; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization","biocide; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; plastic; agricultural land; Article; artificial neural network; carbon footprint; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; cropping system; electricity; energy consumption; genetic algorithm; Iran; irrigation (agriculture); life cycle assessment; machine; market; metaheuristics; multi objective genetic algorithm; multi objective particle swarm optimization; nonhuman; particle swarm optimization; plant life cycle stage; priority journal; tomato","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85075193976",NA,NA

Microplastics have been found in soils across the globe. Like other anthropogenic pollutants, they can negatively affect a range of soil organisms through several mechanisms, though often dependent on particle size, shape and polymer type. However, microplastics are unique among pollutants due to the diversity of ways in which soil organisms may themselves be able to affect their occurrence and distribution and mediate their effects on the rest of the soil food web. In this review, we argue for a more explicitly ecological framing of this novel issue for the soil environment and discuss their potential interactions with soil communities, including microplastic formation via microbial and faunal fragmentation of large plastic debris and organisms such as earthworms placing microplastic particles in unique pedological contexts they could not otherwise reach. Ecological interactions may be crucial for dictating microplastics’ ultimate fate and effect on terrestrial ecosystems.

Evidence on the scale of these impacts has been growing in high-income countries. To date, there has been only limited discussion of how environmental impacts might be incorporated into economic evaluations of health care programs, including health technology assessment. This paper considers why and how this aim might be achieved, using perspectives from both mainstream and ecological economics. There are strong arguments for using economic evaluation to internalise the negative environmental externalities currently being generated by health care, as well as precautionary arguments for health systems to better understand their exposure to their environmental impacts. The paper tests the feasibility of incorporating the costs of greenhouse gas emissions within costing for economic evaluation, and concludes that the use of shadow prices to achieve this aim is feasible. It suggests that this cost-based approach is preferable to more convoluted attempts to incorporate environmental impacts in the outcome component of health economic evaluations. The interaction between overuse, antimicrobial resistance and environmental harms of health care is identified as an area that would benefit from investigation using innovative economic methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological economics; Economic evaluation; Environmental impacts; Externalities; Health care; Health economics","Air pollution; Costs; Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health care; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Waste disposal; Antimicrobial resistances; Ecological economics; Economic evaluations; Externalities; Health economic evaluations; Health economics; Health technology assessments; Inappropriate disposals; Economic and social effects; carbon emission; cost analysis; environmental economics; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; health care; health expenditure; Article; carbon footprint; cost; economic evaluation; environmental economics; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; evidence based medicine; feasibility study; funding; greenhouse gas; health care policy; health care system; human","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85075996128",NA,NA

During the past several decades, Mollisols have lost about 50% of their antecedent organic carbon (C) pool due to soil erosion, degradation, and other unsuitable human activities. Therefore, restoring soil organic C (SOC) to Mollisols via reasonable management is crucial to sustainable development and is important for environmental stability. However, the existing literature on SOC and soil quality has focused on one soil type or on a given region where Mollisols occur, and the degree of SOC depletion and stabilization in Mollisols have not been comprehensively evaluated. Overall, we propose to develop an optimum scheme for managing Mollisols, and we outline specific issues concerning SOC restoration and prevention of SOC depletion. Materials and methods: In this review, we identify the uncertainties involved in analyses of SOC in Mollisols as related to management practices. According to the existing literature on SOC in Mollisols at the global scale, we analyzed the results of SOC depletion research to assess management practices and to estimate the C amount stabilized in Mollisols. Results and discussion: The review shows that the SOC stocks in Mollisols in North America under cropped systems had 51 ± 4 (equiv. mass) Mg ha−1 in the top 30 cm soil layer. The SOC contents in Northeast China decreased from 52 to 24 g kg−1 (46%) after 150 years of cultivation management. All of the Mollisols regions in the world are facing the challenge of SOC loss, and this trend could have a negative influence on global climate change. Hence, it is very important to take proper measures to maintain and enhance organic C contents in Mollisols. Conclusions: We concluded that reasonable management practices, including no-tillage, manure and compost fertilization, crop straw returning, and mulching cultivation, are the recommended technologies. The C restoration in Mollisols is a truly win-win strategy for ensuring the security of food and soil resources while effectively mitigating global climate change. Thus, more attention should be given to protective management and land use for its impacts on SOC dynamics and soil properties in Mollisols regions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon depletion; Carbon restoration; Management practice; Mollisols; Soil organic carbon","compost; environmental restoration; global change; global climate; literature review; management practice; Mollisol; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil quality; soil type; China; North America","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85078303704",NA,NA

Growing evidences demonstrate that the health of the ocean and the health of humans have always been and will continue to be, inextricably linked. Our actions toward the oceans will significantly influence the future of the whole planet and, in turn, our own health. The current review of these issues arose from a summer school in San Sebastian (Spain), from 5th to 7th June, 2019. An interdisciplinary group of researchers discussed key risks (e.g., microbial pollution, pharmaceuticals, harmful algal blooms, plastic pollution) and benefits (e.g., bathing waters, recreation, tourism) of the seas and global ocean for humanity; and debated the future priorities and potential actions for a joint Oceans and Human Health research and governance programme in Europe. The aim of this review is to contribute to the emerging scientific agenda on ocean health and human health, as well as coordinate efforts with stakeholders, policy makers and the general public. This agenda operates within the larger context of the upcoming United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development: 2021–2030, which strives to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including healthy (human) lives and well-being (SDG3) and conserving and sustainably using the oceans (SDG14), among others.

These environments may be considered as biofilters, able to regulate the transport and transformation of OM from land to sea and vice-versa, due to the porous structure of the sediment and the colonisation by microorganisms. The efficiency of OM recycling performed by enzymatic activities (EAs) was evaluated in three beaches of the NW Mediterranean Sea, characterised by different anthropogenic pressure (urbanisation), and morphodynamic characteristics (exposition to waves). The sampling was focused on the area that includes the swash zone and the wet emerged beach. Urbanisation significantly influenced EAs, leading to a decoupling between the lipolytic EAs and the lipid content of sediment. Natural and anthropogenic lipids, showing higher turnover times than other OM (proteins), accumulated in the sediment, notwithstanding the very high lipolytic activities. In the sheltered side of the urbanised sites, significant correlations between EAs, sedimentary OM and seawater inorganic nutrients were recorded, confirming the biofilter activity. In the exposed sites, the wave action increased the exchanges with the sea by water flushing inside the sediment, and EAs were related mainly to salinity. Especially in the least urbanised beach, coarse texture, higher pendency and heterogeneity of the sediment decreased the biofilter activity, allowing photosynthetic producers to increase their biomass. In this case, the beach hosted production of fresh OM, contributing to fulfil the trophic web requirements. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","anthropogenic effect; beach; biofiltration; ecosystem service; enzyme activity; heterogeneity; land-sea interaction; morphodynamics; oligotrophic environment; organic matter; recycling; sand; sediment pollution; Mediterranean Sea","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85077626080",NA,NA

Technologies to improve soil water content (SWC) are necessary for sustainable intensification of maize production. The potential of plastic film mulch and reduced tillage to improve SWC has been reported for the Loess Plateau. However, there has been little research on how tillage management can be integrated with plastic mulching as an approach to improve SWC and maize photosynthesis. A 3-yr field study was conducted to investigate how tillage system influences SWC, photosynthetic performance, grain yield, and grain water use efficiency (WUEg) of plastic-mulched maize in a semiarid environment. Treatments were conventional tillage (CT), rotary tillage (RT), subsoiling (SS), and no-till (NT). Soil water content in the 0–30 cm depth with SS was 24, 31, and 13% greater at the flowering, kernel milk, and physiological maturity stages of maize phenological development, respectively, compared to CT. These improvements in SWC were associated with increased leaf water potential (17%), net assimilation rate (41%), transpiration rate (54%), and stomatal conductance (42%), and decreased intercellular CO2 concentration (15%) and stomatal limitation (20%) with SS compared to CT. Subsoiling used more water (9%) and increased grain yield by 21% compared to CT, thus enhancing WUEg by 11%. On average, reduced tillage systems had improved performance (SS &gt; NT &gt; RT &gt; CT) for almost all parameters measured. These results show that SS is a viable option for increasing grain production of plastic-mulched maize in semiarid areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation tillage; Maize, subsoiling; Photosynthesis; Plastic mulch; Water use efficiency","Cultivation; Efficiency; Landforms; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Sediments; Soil conservation; Soil moisture; Sustainable development; Agricultural sustainability; Conservation tillage; Maize, subsoiling; Net assimilation rates; Plastic mulch; Reduced tillage systems; Semiarid Loess plateau; Water use efficiency; Grain (agricultural product); alternative agriculture; conservation tillage; crop yield; maize; mulch; photosynthesis; precipitation (climatology); semiarid region; soil water; subsoil; water use efficiency; China; Loess Plateau; Zea mays","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85074357860",NA,NA

Results indicate a higher willingness to pay for management options associated with the highest possible levels of marine litter control followed by the highest possible levels of fish health. Using entropy balancing, a multivariate reweighting method to produce balanced samples in observational studies, we also test the impact that having watched the BBC Blue Planet II documentary series may have had on individuals’ willingness to support marine conservation activity. Whether or not respondents had seen the BBC Blue Planet II series was found to have a significant impact on people’s preferences. Despite this, the willingness to pay (WTP) does not differ between the two groups, suggesting that such documentaries may impact preferences but not the final action of WTP.

However, plastic debris, as a consequence of film mulching, remains and accumulates in soil leading to severe soil quality problems, as well as environmental concerns especially the small fragmented particles referred to as microplastics (MPs). Though increasing attention has been aroused for MPs in the aquatic environment, the knowledge of MPs’ behavior and its effects on soil quality is extremely insufficient and urgently needed. In this study, we oriented the benefits of plastic film use, its contribution to agriculture productivity, and the effects of MPs on soil properties and its related soil quality indicators. Admittedly, the increasing trend of using plastic film made by light density of polyethylene would be continued in China, and the pieces of plastic particles would either be persistent and accumulated in soil layers or be slowly aging and degraded. The impacts of MPs on soil quality need more attention due to the limited studies available focusing on its fate and interactions associated with soil ecosystem services and environmental resilience. Although policies and agricultural extending services on plastic film application have been laughed for a few years, alternative materials used for producing environment-friendly film, plastic debris recycling, and solutions on pieced particle removal are the great challenges for sustainable farming. Thus, it is urgent to understand MPs’ effects on soil quality which is crucial for soil-plant system and soil pollution monitoring and prevention. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Microplastics; Plastic film mulching; Risk assessment; Soil quality; Terrestrial ecosystem","","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85093846532",NA,NA

Tehran’s municipal solid-waste management has adopted modern practices and technologies very slowly. This study proposes the optimum pathway to reach maximum environmental benefits as well as the most cost-effective technologies according to the financial limits. The hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA)–emergy approach is applied to utilize the life cycle emissions as an inventory database to estimate the ecosystem services provided by the natural ecosystem to dilute the emissions and compensate raw material consumption. Among organic waste-treatment options, composting is optimally chosen by the hybrid LCA–emergy approach while considering the LCA method solely; the anaerobic digestion is the preferable option. Recycling is the most preferable solution for paper, plastic, and glass in terms of energy recovery and cost saving. However, the budget constraint affects the results. Considering the budget constraint, 65% of ferrous metals are diverted from recycling into metal landfill. Cost reduction of recycling technologies may divert metal flow from landfill to recycling. The limited budget has a significant impact on recycling solutions. Overall, the combination of composting and source separation should be considered as the most sustainable and eco-friendly pathway in Tehran. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Emergy; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste; Tehran","Anaerobic digestion; Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Ecosystems; Environmental technology; Land fill; Life cycle; Recycling; Source separation; Sustainable development; Cost-effective technology; Emergy; Environmental benefits; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Raw material consumption; Recycling technology; Tehran; Waste management systems; Municipal solid waste","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85073997915",NA,NA

They address (i) altered biogeochemical cycles, (ii) ocean acidification, (iii) climate change hotspots, (iv) unexpected dynamism in seabed-dwelling populations, (v) spatial range shifts, (vi) adaptation and thermal resilience, (vii) sea ice related biological fluctuations, (viii) pollution, (ix) endangered terrestrial endemism and (x) the discovery of unknown habitats. Most Antarctic biotas are exposed to multiple stresses and considered vulnerable to environmental change due to narrow tolerance ranges, rapid change, projected circumpolar impacts, low potential for timely genetic adaptation, and migration barriers. Important ecosystem functions, such as primary production and energy transfer between trophic levels, have already changed, and biodiversity patterns have shifted. A confidence assessment of the degree of ‘scientific understanding’ revealed an intermediate level for most of the more detailed sub-messages, indicating that process-oriented research has been successful in the past decade. Additional efforts are necessary, however, to achieve the level of robustness in scientific knowledge that is required to inform protection measures of the unique Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and their contributions to global biodiversity and ecosystem services. © 2020 The Authors.

Their advantages, disadvantages, and application areas are summarized, and the similarities and differences between these two evaluation methods are analyzed respectively. Their research progress is also sorted out. The study finds that EMA and LCA share common attributes in evaluation processes and research fields, but they focus on different aspects of macrocosms and microcosms. The assessment of system sustainability is valued by both EMA and LCA, but the former has unique advantages in natural system input analysis, and the latter is more convincing in assessing environmental loading capacity. If the system boundaries of the two methods are expanded, in other words, factors such as ecosystem services, labor, and infrastructure construction are integrated into the upstream of the target system, and environmental impact is further analyzed using LCA in the downstream of the system, the two approaches would complete each other. The quantified results would be more objective. Therefore, these two theories have the necessity of coupling development. After reviewing recent coupling application cases, the results show that LCA and EMA have commonality in the upstream of the target system (mainly in inventory database construction), while the environmental impact assessment methods are different in the downstream. So the overall coupling analysis method is not formed. The current paper gives rational suggestions on the coupling development of the two systems in terms of the aggregate emergy flow table, the indicator system construction and indicator evaluation methods. In addition, it is necessary to introduce sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis in order to improve the reliability of assessment results. At present, the research on the coupling development of the two theories is in rapid development stage, but there are still many problems that need further exploration. © 2020 by the authors.","Coupling evaluation; Emergy analysis; Life cycle assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis","emergy; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; loading; sensitivity analysis; sustainability; uncertainty analysis","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85079620536",NA,NA

In this sense, biobased plastics arise as an alternative to completely or partly substitute these fossil-based plastics. Nevertheless, it is still unclear if the use of biomass for the production of bioplastics can mitigate the environmental impact of fossil-based plastics and simultaneously provide economic benefits. The proper design of biomass supply chains plays an important role in the development of biobased plastics; however, economic criteria (e.g., maximization of revenues) is the most used parameter to optimize the supply chain, whereas environmental criteria are barely considered. For this purpose, we propose an optimization model that evaluates different supply chain configurations for the production of biobased polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using sugar beet and wheat. The optimization model accounts for the production costs and environmental costs through different methodologies, such as the Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), respectively. We found that the production of biobased terephthalic acid (TPA) directly influences the economic profitability of 100% biobased PET. The selection of feedstock and carbon tax scenario play an important role in the development of biobased supply chains. © 2020, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

To date, however, the fate of potentially toxic plastic additives has received comparatively little attention. In this study, we investigated the fate of the flame retardant hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) in polystyrene (PS)degrading mealworms and in mealworm-fed shrimp. Most of the commercial HBCD consumed by the mealworms was egested in frass within 24 h (1-log removal) with nearly a 3-log removal after 48 h. In mealworms fed PS containing high HBCD levels, only 0.27 ± 0.10%, of the ingested HBCD remained in the mealworm body tissue. This value did not increase over the course of the experiment, indicating little or no bioaccumulation. Additionally, no evidence of higher trophic level bioaccumulation or toxicity was observed when L. vannamei (Pacific whiteleg shrimp) were fed mealworm biomass grown with PS containing HBCD. Differences in shrimp survival were attributable to the fraction of mealworm biomass incorporated into the diet, not HBCD. We conclude that the environmental effects of PS ingestion need further evaluation as the generation of smaller, more contaminated particles is possible, and may contribute to toxicity at nanoscale. © 2019 American Chemical Society","","Additives; Bioaccumulation; Polystyrenes; Shellfish; Toxicity; Body tissues; Hexabromocyclododecanes; Nano scale; Plastic additives; Plastic pollutions; Trophic level; Biochemistry; flame retardant; hexabromocyclododecane; polymer; polystyrene; brominated hydrocarbon; flame retardant; hexabromocyclododecane; polymer; polystyrene derivative; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; biomass; crustacean; ecotoxicology; environmental fate; flame retardant; invertebrate; plastic waste; pollution exposure; polymer; survival; trophic level; animal experiment; Article; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; biomass; body burden; controlled study; diet; excretion; mealworm; method detection limit; nonhuman; Penaeus vannamei; quantitative analysis; shrimp; survival; Tenebrio molitor; tissue distribution; trophic level; animal; bioaccumulation; Tenebrio; Decapoda (Crustacea); Litopenaeus vannamei; Animals; Bioaccumulation; Flame Retardants; Hydrocarbons, Brominated; Polymers; Polystyrenes; Tenebrio","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85084397622",NA,NA

It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources – coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children’s risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals – phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste – can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South – environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth’s resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas. © 2020 The Author(s).","","aromatic hydrocarbon; cosmetic; flame retardant; halogenated hydrocarbon; mercury; methylmercury; microplastic; organometallic compound; perfluoro compound; pesticide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; toxic substance; acidification; algal bloom; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterium; carcinogenesis; cardiovascular disease; climate change; coastal waters; cognition; developmental disorder; diabetes mellitus; dietary pattern; ecotoxicity; endocrine disease; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; evidence based practice; fish stock; fishery; global disease burden; greenhouse effect; health; health hazard; human; immunotoxicity; marine alga; marine environment; marine species; metabolic syndrome X; microplastic pollution; mortality; motor vehicle tire; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; ocean environment; oil spill; plastic pollution; prevention and control; protozoon; risk factor; sea; sea pollution; Vibrio; virus; water pollutant; water pollution control","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85098047537",NA,NA

The raw wastewater was pumped to a 1450 L tank, operated in batch flow and filled with plastic conduits. The second treatment stage was composed of a 1000 L FTW box with a 200 L plastic drum inside (acting as settler in the entrance) and vegetated with mixed ornamental plants species floating in a polyurethane support fed once a week with 700 L of wastewater. In the plant roots, graphite rods were placed to act as cathodes, while on the bottom of the box 40 graphite sticks inside a plastic hose with a stainless-steel cable acting as the anode chamber. Open circuit voltages were daily measured for 6 weeks, and later as closed circuit with the connection of 1000 Ω resistors. Plant harvestings were conducted, in which biomass production and plant uptake from each of the species were measured. On average, system was efficient in reducing BOD5 (55.1%), COD (71.4%), turbidity (90.9%) and total coliforms (99.9%), but presented low efficiencies regarding total N (8.4%) and total P (11.4%). Concerning bioenergy generation, voltage peaks and maximum power density were observed on the feeding day, reaching 225 mV and 0.93 mW/m2, respectively, and in general decaying over the 7 days. In addition, plant species with larger root development presented higher voltage values than plants with the smaller root systems, possible because of oxygen release. Therefore, the combined system presented potential of treating wastewater and generating energy by integrating FTW and MFC, but further studies should investigate the FTW-MFC combination in order to improve its treatment performance and maximize energy generation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bioelectricity; Constructed wetland; Ornamental plants; Phytoremediation; Renewable energy","Biofilters; Biomass; Electrodes; Electrophysiology; Graphite; Microbial fuel cells; Open circuit voltage; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Anaerobic biofilters; Biomass productions; Energy generations; Floating treatment wetlands; Maximum power density; Ornamental plants; Treatment performance; University campus; Sewage treatment plants","Article","Article in Press",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85092723815",NA,NA

This study aims to find out whether the application of the theory of planned behavior departs from the knowledge of the influence of environmental awareness and leads to interest in the use of reusable bags. Quantitative methods used in this study includes the determination of samples with non-probability techniques, namely purposive sampling. The research instrument was an online questionnaire of 300 respondents in Bali, who had never used a repetitive shopping bag. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling with the SmartPLS application. The application of the theory of planned behavior shows that testing knowledge of the environment and environmental stewardship gives a positive attitude and becomes a control behavior and interest in the use of reusable bag products. However, it is different from Subjective Norms which do not have a significant influence on the interest in using reusable bags. So, it is a concern for the government to always provide socialization, knowledge and environmental awareness about the importance of protecting the environment by using non-disposable shopping bags, and also business owners or marketing management to provide more reusable bags. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Attitudes; Behavior; Environmental Concern; Green Products; Knowledge; Norms; Planned Behavior","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85089396666",NA,NA

Triggered by biophysical constraints as well as rapid structural and technological developments, new management practices are emerging with largely unknown impacts on soil processes and functions. This impedes assessments of the potential of such emerging practices for sustainable intensification, a paradigm coined to address the growing demand for food and nonfood products. In terms of soil management, sustainable intensification means that soil productivity is increased while other soil functions and services, such as carbon storage and habitat for organisms, are simultaneously maintained or even improved. In this paper we provide an overview of research challenges to better understand how emerging soil management practices affect soil processes and functions. We distinguish four categories of soil management practices: spatial arrangements of cropping systems, crops and rotations, mechanical pressures, and inputs into the soil. Key research needs identified for each include nutrient efficiency in agroforestry versus conventional cropping systems, soil-rhizosphere microbiome elucidation to understand the interacting roles of crops and rotations, the effects of soil compaction on soil–plant–atmosphere interactions, and the ecotoxicity of plastics, pharmaceuticals and other pollutants that are introduced into the soil. We establish an interdisciplinary, systemic approach to soil science and include cross-cutting research activities related to process modeling, data management, stakeholder interaction, sustainability assessment and governance. The identification of soil research challenges from the perspective of agricultural management facilitates cooperation between different scientific disciplines in the field of sustainable agricultural production. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Agricultural management; Future; Research challenges; Soil functions","","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85080028977",NA,NA

The Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is one of the typical E-waste components that comprise large varieties of metals and nonmetals. Urban Mining of these metals has received major attention all over the world. The existing treatment procedures used extensively for the resource extraction are hydrometallurgy and pyro-metallurgy and crude recycling practices in the informal sector. However, these methods are prone to cause secondary pollutants with certain drawbacks. Also, the existing informal recycling procedures resulted in insignificant occupational health hazards and severe environmental threats. The application of biotechnology is extensively exploited for metal extraction and emerged as one of the sustainable and eco-friendly tools. However, a limited field-scale study is prevailing in the realm of resource recovery from E-waste using bioleaching method. Hence, the application of bioleaching requires more attention and technical know-how in developing countries to curtail crude practices. The application of bioleaching in E-waste, including its available methods, kinetics mechanism associated opportunities, and barriers, have been discussed in this paper. A glance of E-waste management in India and the menace of 95% crude E-waste recycling are also elaborated.

Mountains of solid waste are increasing in every country making solid waste management a challenge almost everywhere on Earth. It is vital to look for such municipal solid waste management solutions that are financially sustainable, technically possible, socially and legally acceptable and environmentally friendly. Currently vermicomposting is the only biological solid waste treatment process that uses multicellular organisms to biodegrade organic wastes. A few species of insects are capable of digesting lignin and cellulose. Of these, termites are the most numerous and play a decisive role as scavengers. Microflora which inhabit the termites’ gut contribute to their waste degrading potential. Termites act as major soil ecosystem managers and are able to breakdown and recycle organic matter and composite. Although studies in the potential of termites to increase soil fertility are well-accounted for in the literature, the potential of termites for solid waste management still needs to be explored. This mini review presents the state of information on the use of termite species in solid waste degradation focused on the potential application in the Himachal Pradesh region, India.

The conc. of 16 priority PHAs in soils from the urbanized/ industrialized outskirts in the vicinity of Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company were analyzed along with their associations with soil properties, its sources and spatial distribution. The selected soil properties include total organic carbon (% TOC), soil pH and cation exchange capacity. The pH of the soil samples varies from 7.0 to 8.2 with an average of 7.7. The total organic matter ranged from 0.2% to 3.6% with an average of 0.8 %. The CEC ranged from 14.46 to 42.9 cmol [Na+]/ Kg with an average of 28.5 cmol (Na+]/ Kg. PAHs were analyzed by using High Performance Liquid Chromatography having fluorescence detector. Only 11 PAH compounds were detected in almost all samples; anthracene, naphthalene, acenaphthene, anthracene, pyrene, fluorine, benzo[a] and benzo[b] fluoranthene, benzo[k] fluoranthene, benzo[a] perylene, dibenzo [g.h.i] pyrene and dibenzo[a, h] anthracene from the screened EPA 16 priority PAHs.

Coastal and marine tourism cities are the largest and fastest growing segment of the tourism industry. City infrastructures are being developed in the absence of a solid-waste management capacity and create a gap in the measurement of sustainable solid-waste management. This study employs both qualitative techniques and quantitative measures to extend the literature. An exploratory factor analysis is applied to test the proposed hierarchical framework's validity and reliability. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation and a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory are used to evaluate sustainable solid-waste management in the cities. A set of criteria that consider the economic benefit, environment assessment and social impact are constructed on six aspects: funding and expenditures, tourism activities, the policy and legal framework, environmental co-creation, stakeholder participation and community awareness. The result reveals the causal interrelationships among the aspects and that stakeholder participation, tourism activities, and the policy and legal framework are the causal attributes for achieving sustainability performance. Civil construction debris, the tourist flow, the support of political leadership, cost-sharing and mutual strategy adoption, and technical cooperation are also found to be success criteria that contribute as practical guidelines for practitioners and communities.

Kathryn Harrison later applied this typology to pollution control in her popular ‘Talking with the Donkey’ piece. Though command-and-control instruments were central up until the late 1990s, growing global interest in ‘New Environmental Policy Instruments’ (NEPI) led to a disinterest in regulatory mechanisms and an increase in attention to information-based and economic instruments. Are governments using regulation as a policy instrument now more than before or are they choosing policy mixes? In this paper, I examine the state of the art regarding regulation as an environmental policy instrument by exploring whether the apparent shift to NEPI did reduce interest in environmental regulation as a policy instrument. I find that policy experiments with models of policy instruments led to increased interest in policy instrument mixes. Evidence from a systematic review of JEPP scholarship and a broader scholarly review of the literature on environmental policy instruments over the past 20 years focused on drinking water and solid waste governance suggest that policy mixes might work best when faced with conditions of uncertainty and governance complexity. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Environmental regulation; governance; instrument choice; policy instruments; policy mixes","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85087812544",NA,NA

The industrial nature of active ports can, however, provide various problems when attempting to carry out monitoring programmes. Current methodologies designed to identify NNS and to describe fouling communities have not been developed specifically for use in active ports and can encounter a number of issues when used in these environments. Here, two surveys were developed and trialled within an active port in South Wales, UK, designed to describe fouling communities, identify NNS and overcome some of the major limitations to conducting surveys within ports. Over a 6-month period, fouling communities dominated by solitary ascidians developed in each survey. Seven NNS were identified, mostly species already recorded in the 1950s, including the Mediterranean crab Brachynotus sexdentatus, and the more recently introduced Japanese skeleton shrimp Caprella mutica. Each survey was evaluated independently with respect to key factors, including the ability to detect NNS and practical aspects of using these survey methods in an applied context. We conclude that whilst each survey can function independently, the use of both survey types in conjunction offers the most robust solution to identifying NNS and describing wider fouling communities within active ports. This research has implications for the future monitoring and management of NNS within UK ports. Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

However, there is a lack of attention to outdoor companies’ views in academic literature. We begin to address this gap by examining outdoor companies’ websites. Results indicate that through claims of unparalleled experience and expertise, business leadership in the fight against climate change, and technological innovations for developing sustainable outdoor gear, companies claim mindful consumption of their products can improve recreationists’ outdoor experiences without harming the environment. We contend that outdoor companies use authenticity rhetoric to promote neoliberal notions of sustainability and justify technology use in outdoor recreation, thus situating outdoor recreation in discussions of neoliberal sustainability in nature-based tourisms. By utilizing authenticity rhetoric infused with countercultural outdoor recreation values, outdoor companies assert their authority over nature, positioning themselves as ethical environmental leaders.

Understanding the causes of this persistent failure is a necessary step towards more effective action. This article contributes to that understanding by synthesizing theory and evidence that links unsustainable production-consumption systems to power and inequality. While sustainable consumption and production research and action mostly focuses on technological or behavioral change, the socio-ecological inequalities driving production-consumption systems built into the organization of our global political economy, remain largely overlooked. In response, we propose a structural political economy orientation that seeks explicitly to reduce these inequalities and advance environmental justice and, thus, create the conditions for sustainable production-consumption systems. We then propose three important arenas of research and action towards sustainable production-consumption systems: justice, governance, and co-production of knowledge and action. These arenas, collectively and individually, can serve as entry points to study and act on the dynamics of (un)sustainable production-consumption systems. This can be done at the micro level, with respect to specific commodity chains or systems of provisioning, or at meso and macro levels with respect to national and global production networks. Our proposed orientation helps distinguish research and practice proposals into those emphasizing management and compensation resulting often in persistence of unsustainability, from those proffering structural changes in unsustainable production-consumption systems. We invite critique and collaboration to develop this research and action agenda further. © 2020","Environmental governance; Environmental justice; Global inequality; Political economy; Power; Sustainable consumption and production","Ecology; Behavioral changes; Co-production of knowledge; Environmental justice; Global production networks; Political economy; Production research; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable production; Sustainable development; behavior change; compensation; extraction; justice; review; synthesis; theoretical study","Review","Article in Press",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85095943629",NA,NA

Design/methodology/approach: SSCIs are identified by reviewing the extant literature and topic modeling. Further, they are evaluated based on existing SDGs and ranked using the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Notably, the evaluation of indicators is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process within a fuzzy environment. The methodology has been explained using a case study from the automobile industry. Findings: The case study identifies appropriate SSCIs and differentiates them among peer suppliers for gaining a competitive advantage. The results reveal that top-ranked sustainability indicators include the management of natural resources, energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and social investment. Practical implications: The study outcome will enable suppliers, specialists and decision makers to understand the criteria that improve supply chain sustainability in the automobile industry. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the competitive package of indicators for gaining strategic advantage. This proactive sustainability indicator selection promotes and enhances sustainability reporting while fulfilling regulatory requirements and increasing collaboration potential with trustworthy downstream partners. This study sets the stage for further research in SSCIs’ competitive strategy in the automobile industry along with its supply chains. Originality/value: This study is unique as it provides a framework for determining relevant SSCIs, which can be distinguished from peer suppliers, while also matching economic, environmental and social metrics to achieve a competitive advantage. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Competitive advantage; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Sustainability priorities; Sustainable supply chain management; Topic modeling","","Article","Article in Press",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85096017647",NA,NA

The author argues the claims we make about who we are and what we stand for powerfully influence us, and our social world. Asking questions such as: Why do people resist the temptation to cheat when cheating would benefit them greatly and no one would find out? Why do people express different beliefs about climate change when they are first reminded of their political affiliation? Why do people prefer to be compensated for donating blood with cholesterol screening than with money? Miller puts forth a novel and compelling argument regarding how strongly our identity claims affect our daily lives. The book provides explanations for many forms of puzzling behavior, such as why people sometimes act against their economic self-interest, how they avoid situations that test their moral identities, and how they respond to failures to live up to their moral identities. It paints an intriguing picture of people’s investment in their identity claims by showing how they seek opportunities to demonstrate their validity, avoid actions and circumstances that challenge their legitimacy, and employ psychological defenses when others challenge their legitimacy. Based on extensive research in the fields of psychology, economics, and political science, this book is fascinating reading for students and academics interested in identity and the self.

The purpose of this paper is to address the necessity of these principles in order for a circular economy (CE) to be sustainable. Design/methodology/approach: This is a general review paper explaining today’s shortcomings in a CE and in the waste hierarchy. Its theoretical contribution is illustrated using the example of marine plastic waste in the Arctic, as well as the EU’s action plan for a CE: “Closing the loop”. Findings: There is a need to reduce raw materials into the economy directly and not only as a potential result of recycling. This is supported theoretically and by illustrating that the EU’s action plan is closing the loop primarily from the output side. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical possibility of complete recycling rests on a premise that is now at odds with a sustainable development. Social implications: The power of existing raw material production cycles must be challenged to allow reduction to be a real option. If not, a CE may exacerbate a moral trade-off by the current generation reducing the safe operating space of future living beings. Originality/value: The theoretical possibility of recycling everything, also known as the technology-optimist view, has played the role of a safety net for humanity. As we are now exceeding planetary boundaries for a safe and just space for humanity, this theoretical safety net is no longer valid. Instead, we must reinforce the basic principles of the hierarchy of resource use. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Circular economy; Ecology; Resources; Social justice; Sustainability; Waste hierarchy","action plan; environmental economics; future prospect; hierarchical system; marine pollution; plastic waste; resource use; social justice; sustainability; theoretical study; Europe","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85077870379",NA,NA

Extruded polystyrene (XPS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS), specifically, have become some of the most prominent types of marine litter found around Europe's coastlines. To combat this problem, the European Commission has ratified a series of regulations and policies, including the Single-Use Plastics Directive and the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy. However, in order to ensure that the benefits of such regulations and policies are realized at a scale that can adequately address the scope of the problem, decision-makers will need to integrate the opinions, values, and priorities of relevant stakeholders who operate across the EPS/XPS product lifecycle. In this study, we apply a 35-statement Q-methodology to identify the priorities of stakeholders as they relate to the Irish EPS/XPS market and the wider societal transition to a circular economy. Based on the responses of nineteen individuals representing industry, policy-makers, and community leaders, we identified three distinct perspectives: System Overhaul; Incremental Upgrade; and Market Innovation. The results demonstrate that the type and format of policy interventions linked to Ireland's EPS/XPS circular economy are heavily contested, which presents significant challenges for driving the debate forward. These results provide valuable information on viewpoints that can be used by different stakeholders at national and EU levels to address areas of conflict, ultimately fostering the development of more effective, broadly supported co-developed policies. © 2019 by the authors.","Circular economy; Ireland; Marine litter; Polystyrene; Q-methodology; Stakeholder","decision making; European Commission; litter; marine environment; plastic; stakeholder; waste management; Ireland","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85076601052",NA,NA

However, the potential for industrial symbiosis is not exhausted in existing cases, and there is still a wide range of opportunities for its application. Through a comprehensive literature review, this article aims to compile and analyse studies that focus on potential industrial symbiosis in real contexts, to highlight the margin of optimisation that is not being used. The cases reported in the publications identified here were characterised and analysed according to geographic location, type of economic activity, waste/by-products, main benefits, and the methods employed in the studies. From this analysis, we conclude that there is great potential for applications involving industrial symbiosis throughout the world, and especially in Europe, corresponding to 53% of the total cases analysed. Manufacturing stood out as the sector with the highest potential for establishing symbiosis relationships, and the most common types of waste streams in potential networks were organic, plastic and rubber, wood, and metallic materials. This article also discusses the main drivers and barriers to realising the potential of industrial symbiosis. The diversity of industries, geographical proximity, facilitating entities and legislation, plans, and policies are shown to be the main drivers. © 2019 by the authors.","Circular economy; Eco-industrial parks; Industrial symbiosis; Potential industrial symbiosis; Sustainability","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85082674404",NA,NA

The purpose of the present work was to introduce a new holistic approach to urban mobility system (UMS) planning, which involves a strategic decision-making process with a broad involvement of various stakeholders. For this purpose, an innovative model was created by synthesizing the focus group (FG) method with the nominal group technique (NGT), SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis, and the fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) method. The fuzzy approach was chosen for its ability to incorporate imprecise and vague information and make a decision-making UMS process more realistic. Accordingly, the objective of the paper was to propose a newly developed model that will (considering the integration of various urban mobility subsystems) enable the detection, identification, and ranking of key priorities required for a more holistic approach to UMS planning. The results revealed that the developed integrated model enables acquired areas to be ranked according to priorities, which further allows the development of scenarios. Moreover, the model allows a better understanding of how to search for compromises when one is faced with multi-criteria decision-making and coordination of frequently contradictory goals. A new integrated urban mobility model, as proposed herein, was also successfully tested in a real-life application, which proves its potential for use in sustainable urban mobility planning in a holistic way. © 2019 by the authors.

Total microbial respiration was measured for incubated soil with and without the input of straw. Results indicated that soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under ST, NT and CT was higher in soil with straw input than that without, while the microbial quotient (MQ or MBC: SOC) and metabolic quotient (qCO2) content under CT followed the opposite trend. Lower temperature, lower moisture and with straw input contributed to the increases in SOC concentration, especially under NT and ST systems. The SOC concentrations under ST, with temperatures of 30 and 35°C after incubation at 55% FMC, were greater than those under CT by 28.4% and 30.6%, respectively. The increase in MBC was highest at 35°C for 55%, 65% and 75% FMC; in soil under ST, MBC was greater than that under CT by 199.3%, 50.7% and 23.8%, respectively. At 30°C, the lower qCO2 was obtained in soil incubated under NT and ST. The highest MQ among three tillage practices was measured under ST at 55% FMC, NT at 65% FMC and CT at 75% FMC with straw input. These data indicate the benefits of enhancing the MQ; the low FMC was beneficial to ST treatment.

However, realising a circular economy has ran into various biophysical constraints. Circular economy implementation is shaped by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's butterfly diagram that depicts ‘biological’ and ‘technical’ flows as separate cycles, subsequently interpreted as organic materials circulating in open loop systems via the environment and inorganic materials circulating in closed loop systems within society. Conversely, in our view, resource flows often contain tightly bound combinations of organic and inorganic materials either due to their natural composition or due to their technical design. Building on this observation, a new diagram is proposed that broadens the scope of the circular economy to cover extractive sectors and the return of materials from anthropogenic use to natural reserves, thereby reshaping the conceptual space within which solutions such as effective zero-waste-residue technologies, business models, and policies can be developed for the optimal management of integrated resources from a whole-system perspective. The diagram offers a realistic outlook on the biophysical limitations of circularity and endeavours to inspire discussion that supports the transition towards a sustainable circular economy. © 2019","Circular business models; Governance; Resource efficiency; Resource recovery technology; Waste management; Whole system design","inorganic compound; iron; organic compound; biogeochemical cycling; biophysics; circular business model; circular economy; economic aspect; environmental decision making; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental protection; environmental sanitation; iron and steel industry; natural resource; nonbiological model; Note; priority journal; recycling; renewable energy; waste disposal; waste management","Note","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85068257718",NA,NA

To comprehensively evaluate the sustainability of the cucumber production systems under two planting patterns (the protected cucumber production system and the field cucumber production system), and to provide constructive suggestions for an efficient and sustainable development of the production systems, the emergy evaluation method was utilized to analyze the composition and metabolism of the emergy flows in the production systems based on 2016 provincial data from China. The results show that the mean value of natural resources input of the field cucumber production system (13.59E+14 sej/ha) was significantly higher than that of the protected cucumber production system (5.92E+14 sej/ha). However, the mean values of the purchased resources input, total emergy input and total energy output had the contrary trend. The extent to which the cucumber production systems under two planting patterns are dependent on the environment is different. The field cucumber production system uses more natural resources and the degree of utilization of natural resources is geographically distributed. More natural resources are utilized in the south of China where natural conditions are better. However, the protected cucumber production system uses more purchased resources, especially the nonrenewable resources, and has the characteristics of high input, high output but low production efficiency. Improving the efficiency of resources utilization, using more clean energy and improving the degree of mechanization will contribute to a cleaner, more efficient and sustainable development of the cucumber production system. © 2019 The Authors","Emergy evaluation; Facility agriculture; Planting patterns; Sustainability; Vegetable","Environmental protection; Machinery; Planning; Sustainable development; Vegetables; Emergy evaluation; Essential minerals; Facility agricultures; Natural conditions; Non-renewable resource; Planting patterns; Production efficiency; Resources utilizations; Economics","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85069855292",NA,NA

This study aims to investigate the life cycle assessment and social cost of life cycle assessment of waste polyester recycling. The results show that the polyester recycling process itself has significant environmental impact on global warming, fossil resource scarcity, human carcinogenic toxicity, water consumption and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Global warming, terrestrial ecotoxicity and land use are the most influential categories of social cost of life cycle assessment, with a contribution of 55.7%, 10.9% and 6.3% respectively. Through key process identification, sensitivity analysis and integrated evaluation study, it is found that electricity generation, direct air emissions and transportation are key processes that affect social cost of life cycle assessment and life cycle assessment. The effects of these key processes on social cost of life cycle assessment are greater than that on life cycle assessment.

This paper presents stages where and how waste occurs along the path from the ground to the table for a period of 7 years, from 2010 to 2016 in the 28 member countries of the European Union (EU28). Considering the specific conditions of the EU28 community, four different sectors with 26 commodities and waste types that occur in those sectors were analysed: 5 commodities in the Fruit sector, 10 commodities in the Vegetable sector, 7 commodities in the Cereal sector and 4 commodities in the Animal sector. The analysis consists of three stages of waste appearance: production (harvesting, farming), processing and consumption (raw, uncooked food). Production data were taken from Eurostat, import and export data were taken from FAOSTAT. Methodology and calculations consist of relations between specific values. Those specific values for every commodity are the production data, import and export data, and consumption of raw food by the inhabitants of a country. Total consumption of raw food by inhabitant is calculated from the specific consumption per capita and population. The results of the study showed that from 2010 to 2016 in the EU28 the estimated quantity of the AWCB appeared to be around 18.4 billion tonnes, with the sector percentages as follows: Animal ~31%, Vegetable ~44%, Cereal ~22% and Fruit ~2%. In the Animal sector, the most dominant were developed countries, with high population density and high level of industrialisation. The Cereal, Fruit and Vegetable sectors have shown to generate higher AWCB quantities in the countries with more available land area and appropriate climate conditions. © 2019 The Authors","Agricultural co- and by- products; AgroCycle; EU28; Resource availability","Agricultural wastes; Animals; Fruits; Population statistics; Vegetables; AgroCycle; Developed countries; EU28; Fruit and vegetables; High population density; Import and exports; Resource availability; Technical potential; Geographical distribution; byproduct; crop residue; European Union; geographical distribution; resource availability; waste management; agricultural worker; article; bakery product; calculation; climate; developed country; European Union; fruit; geographic distribution; human; industrialization; population density; raw food; vegetable; agriculture; animal; European Union; waste; Europe; Animalia; Agriculture; Animals; European Union; Fruit; Vegetables; Waste Products","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85066931497",NA,NA

European countries are committed to improving the environmental status of the marine and coastal environment by 2020, and to do this, they need to reduce the gap of knowledge about litter accumulation patterns in coastal environments. We analyzed the distribution pattern of waste, differentiated by material and origin, in the coastal dune vegetation mosaic along protected natural areas in the Adriatic seashore (central Italy). Litter data were collected following a random stratified procedure. We registered litter occurrence on 180 (2 × 2 m) sampling plots randomly distributed in the different habitats of European conservation concern mapped for the analyzed protected areas. Litter was classified by origin and material, and their abundance on different habitats was explored by multivariate ordination techniques and tested by nonparametric ANOVA followed by Mann-Whitney pairwise post-hoc tests. Most of the plots included at least one waste element being plastic. Plastic was the most abundant material, and fishing and touristic the most polluting activities. Waste distribution varies across coastal dune vegetation types and involves the back dune zone too.

The method of sanitary landfilling for final disposal of waste remains a generally accepted and used method but the available scientific evidence on the waste-related environmental and health effects is not conclusive. Comparative studies of various WM methods (landfilling, incineration, composting etc.) show that among the municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment and disposal technological options, sanitary landfilling or open dumping is popular in most countries because of the relative low cost and low-technical requirement. The European Union (EU) Directive on waste landfills has introduced specific goals for reducing the volume of disposed waste and very strict requirements for landfilling and landfill sites. Evaluation of the impact of landfills on the environment is a crucial topic in the literature and has received increased attention recently, given growing environmental concerns. The main goal of this survey was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of possible impacts of MSW landfills on the environment. The main conclusion of the overall assessment of the literature is that the disposal of MSW in landfills entails a number of environmental risks but with respect to the current situation and rich style of living adopted in industrially developed countries, the idea of WM systems functioning without landfilling—at least in the foreseeable future within one generation—seems to be somewhat unreal. The results also provided important information of landfills as a source of environmental risk. Results of this research may have an important impact on landfill management and the disposal of waste. From the literature review, it is evident that even if high levels of waste avoidance, reuse and recycling are achieved, some waste materials will always need to be forwarded for disposal. © 2019 by the author.

It will also help to address urban problems including resource security, waste disposal, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, heating, drought and flooding. Taking a circular approach can also tackle many other socio-economic problems afflicting cities, for example, providing access to affordable accommodation, expanding and diversifying the economic base, building more engaged and collaborative communities in cities. Thus it has great potential to improve our urban living environments. To date, the industrial ecologists and economists have tended to dominate the circularity debate, focusing on closed-loop industrial systems and circular economy (circular businesses and systems of provision). In this paper I investigate why the current state-of-the-art conceptualisation for circular economy (RESOLVE) is inadequate when applied to a city. Through this critique and a broader review of the literature I identify the principles and components which are lacking from the circular economy (CE) conceptualisation when applied to a city. I then use this to develop my own definition and conceptualisation of a circular approach to urban resource management. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.","circular economy; environment; infrastructure; land use; planning; policy; sustainability","drought; economic conditions; greenhouse gas; land use; resource management; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; urban area; urban economy","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85060763685",NA,NA

Whereas, its generalizability in term of soil and underground water contamination, air pollution, and combating global warming is renowned a complex and problematic endeavor. The study presents a critical exposition in terms of efficiency (technical, technological, and ecological), sustainability pillars, and recent world-wide management practices to establish a new paradigm for MSW to energy. A primary objective of this study is to identify influencing factors and set forth viable indicators and metrics in term of MSW from different standpoints hiring innovative tangible and non-tangible tools and techniques. An inclusive strategy and model in term of an exhaustive paradigm is demonstrated with a real-world application with some significant implications for future practice as a multilateral planning and design reference for students, researchers, scholars, and practitioners in the context of MSW to energy. This is the first ever effort that designed a novel-integrated paradigm framework for MSW to energy within multidisciplinary-oriented approaches of engineering, management, business, and social.

Plastic bags contain additives that during rainfall events can leach out from bags into sand dune and be absorbed by seeds and roots of plants. Dune plants play a fundamental role in dune system formation, yet the possible impact of bag leaching on their establishment and development has been neglected. We assessed in laboratory whether (i) not biodegradable bags (high-density polyethylene, PE) and new generation of compostable bags (Mater-bi®, MB) would influence via leaching water chemical/physical properties and (ii) leachates would affect germination and seedling growth using Thinopyrum junceum and Glaucium flavum as models. Leachates were obtained from different amounts of not-exposed and bags exposed to beach or marine conditions simulating various pollution degrees (none, low, intermediate and high pollution). All water variables were affected by leaching. The magnitude of these alterations depended on bag type and environmental exposure. Seeds of T. junceum treated with the high concentration of marine-exposed MB bag leachate germinated later than controls while those of G. flavum treated with the remaining leachates germinated earlier. For both species, leachates from the low concentration of PE and MB marine-exposed bags increased seed germinability. A short radicle was observed in T. junceum seedlings treated with not-exposed MB bag leachates. Glaucium flavum seedlings treated with beach- and marine-exposed PE bags and not-exposed MB bags leachates showed a greater below-aboveground length ratio and those grown with the low concentration of not-exposed PE bag leachate had a longer hypocotyl compared to controls. Leachates from the high concentration of PE and MB bag caused seedling anomalies in both species. These findings indicate that not biodegradable and compostable bags may interact with abiotic/biotic factors and affect via leaching germination phenology, seedling establishment and plant interactions with consequences on dune community structure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Compostable bag; Glaucium flavum; Polyethylene bag; Seed germination; Seedling growth; Thinopyrum junceum","Additives; Beaches; Cultivation; Forestry; Leaching; Marine pollution; Plastic containers; Polyethylenes; Compostable bag; Glaucium flavum; Seed germination; Seedling growth; Thinopyrum; Seed; plastic; polyethylene; plastic; angiosperm; concentration (composition); dune; environmental impact; germination; grass; leachate; plastic waste; seed propagation; abiotic stress; Agropyron; Article; biotic stress; community structure; controlled study; Elymus; environmental exposure; environmental impact; germination; leaching; nonhuman; plant development; plant growth; plant root; plant seed; priority journal; sand; vegetation; analysis; drug effect; ecosystem; plant; seedling; toxicity; waste; water pollutant; Glaucium flavum; Thinopyrum junceum; Ecosystem; Germination; Plant Roots; Plants; Plastics; Seedlings; Seeds; Waste Products; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85066250705",NA,NA

Indeed, organic amendments of different origin and composition (e.g., animal slurry, manure, compost, sewage sludge, etc.) can supply valuable nutrients to the soil, as well as increase its organic matter content, with concomitant benefits for soil health. However, the application of organic amendments to agricultural soil entails a variety of risks for environmental and human health. Organic amendments often contain a range of pollutants, including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, potential human pathogens, and emerging pollutants. Regarding emerging pollutants, the presence of antibiotic residues, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and antibiotic-resistance genes in agricultural amendments is currently a matter of much concern, due to the concomitant risks for human health. Similarly, currently, the introduction of microplastics to agricultural soil, via the application of organic amendments (mainly, sewage sludge), is a topic of much relevance, owing to its magnitude and potential adverse effects for environmental health. There is, currently, much interest in the development of efficient strategies to mitigate the risks associated to the application of organic amendments to agricultural soil, while benefiting from their numerous advantages. © 2019 by the authors","Agricultural systems; Antibiotic resistance; Food security; Soil conservation; Soil health; Sustainable intensification","","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85072195352",NA,NA

However, despite the current lack on studies on how migrants' transition into waste sorting schemes at the household level, this scoping review was able to provide a broad picture of the engagement in daily activities that support sustainability, such as household waste sorting. Given the current initiatives to develop efficient resource recovery from waste, such knowledge contributes to efforts to engage households with different cultures and experiences in waste sorting. The results highlight the importance of future research to better understand how people who are new to waste management schemes experience these, and study the way that engagement in waste sorting shifts and transforms.

Their availability is strongly affected by soil physiochemical and biological properties. Here we conducted a field study in an arid region of northwestern China to investigate how L-Pi and L-Po dynamics are affected by changes in physiochemical and biological variables caused by agricultural cultivation of calcareous soils. Topsoils were sampled at multiple sites from natural calcareous grasslands and cultivated farmlands of different ages (32–40 vs. 90–100 years) that had been converted from natural grasslands. We measured L-Pi and L-Po concentrations and a set of key physiochemical (soil pH, concentrations of base cations (K+ + Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+), acid anions (Cl− + NO3 − + SO4 2−), nitrate and ammonium nitrogen (N), organic carbon, and total P) and biological (soil microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), alkaline phosphatase activity (Aalp), and abundances of soil macroinvertebrates (Amacro) and mesoinvertebrates (Ameso)) variables. The concentration of L-Pi and L-Po was 484% and 128% higher and their proportion in the total P content was 354% and 78% higher in young farmland soils, whereas L-Pi and L-Po concentrations were 583% and 423% higher and their proportions were 353% and 240% higher in old farmland soils compared to grassland soils. Increases in L-Pi and L-Po attributable to soil P release may be driven by crucial processes of soil acidification-induced phosphate dissolution and soil biota-driven Po mineralisation. Path analyses revealed that L-Pi and L-Po dynamics were shaped by the complex interactions among five key controlling factors, soil pH, nitrate-N, Ameso, Cmic, and Aalp, involved in these crucial processes. We conclude that cultivation of calcareous soils significantly increases the availability of L-Pi and L-Po, emphasizing the importance of this land-use change as a regulator of P cycling in calcareous soils. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Calcareous soils; Labile phosphorus; Land-use change; Phosphorus release; Soil acidification; Soil biota","Acidification; Alkalinity; Cultivation; Dynamics; Farms; Land use; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Phosphatases; Phosphorus; Polonium compounds; Regression analysis; Sodium bicarbonate; Calcareous soils; Land-use change; Phosphorus release; Soil acidifications; Soil biota; Soils; alkaline phosphatase; calcium ion; chlorine; magnesium ion; nitrate; nitrogen; organic carbon; organophosphorus compound; phosphate; potassium ion; sodium ion; sulfate; nitrogen; phosphate; phosphorus; acidification; calcareous soil; concentration (composition); cultivation; land use change; phosphorus; phosphorus cycle; soil biota; agricultural land; Article; calcareous soil; China; dynamics; field study; grassland; invertebrate; land use; macroinvertebrate; mesoinvertebrate; microbial biomass; nonhuman; phosphorus cycle; population abundance; priority journal; soil; soil acidity; soil chemistry; tillage; agriculture; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; procedures; soil; soil pollutant; Agriculture; China; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Soil; Soil Pollutants","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85065614410",NA,NA

While desirable, recycling of plastics is currently constrained by material and chemical complexity, limitations in available technologies, and market demands. This article provides a brief introduction to plastic materials, marine plastic pollution, and its potential effects on marine ecosystems and human health. We also discuss some of the policy and technical issues and suggest priorities for further research. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in urban agriculture in many wealthy, developed cities, with new technology and agro-architecture being employed to grow food in cities at commercial scale. This has been accompanied by an increase in media coverage. Big claims are being made, including that urban agriculture can decrease greenhouse emissions, ‘climate proof’ farms, help solve food security for growing urban populations and provide chemical free food with no risk of pests and diseases. Many of these claims need to be rigorously tested to ensure that sound investments can be made in enterprises that are financially viable and capable of delivering on claims of social and environmental benefits. Around the world, traditional broadacre and horticulture farming have been underpinned by years of biological, chemical, physical, economic and social research. Urban agriculture needs similar support as the industry grows and develops around the world. There are opportunities to improve crop yields and quality by pairing advancements in environmental controls, phenomics and automation with breeding efforts to adapt traits for architecture, development and quality (taste and nutrition) allowing a more diverse set of crops to be grown in controlled-environment farms. Urban farms are uniquely placed to take advantage of urban waste energy, water and nutrients but innovations are needed to use these resources safely and economically. This review discusses the technological research and innovations necessary for urban agriculture to meet the nutritional requirements of growing urban populations. © 2019","Consumer driven traits; Controlled environment agriculture; Horticulture breeding; Indoor farm; Urban farm","crop improvement; crop plant; crop production; food security; horticulture; plant breeding; population growth; profitability; strategic approach; urban agriculture; urban population","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85065641615",NA,NA

Alternate land uses, that is, horti-pasture systems (HPSs) with Emblica officinalis and Psidium guajava trees and pasture (Cenchrus ciliaris + Stylosanthes seabrana), were introduced with different soil moisture conservation measures (staggered contour trenches [T1], continuous contour trenches [T2], stone mulch [T3], vegetative barriers [T4], and control [T5]) for reclamation of degraded land and to test their capacity to perform ecological functions and provide economic return to the farmers. After 10 years, T1 increased soil organic carbon by ~58% and 15% over control in Emblica- and Psidium-based HPS, respectively. T1 stipulated fruit and pasture yield by ~45% and 90% and 32% and 22% over control plots, in those HPS, respectively; T1 also improved fodder and fruit quality. Changing climates significantly affected the fruit and pasture yield. Despite this, T1 assured a benefit–cost ratio of 3.78 and 4.23 in those HPSs, respectively. The sustainable yield index for fruit and pasture in T1 were approximately (a) 1.85 and 1.68 and (b) 1.33 and 1.25 times higher than control, for Emblica- and Psidium-based HPS, respectively. Soil moisture conservation could enhance profit by ~30% and 20% in those HPSs, respectively over control. T1 can potentially recycle approximately (a) 83%, 77%, and 71% and (b) 62%, 122%, and 81% higher N, P, and K than control in those HPSs, respectively.

In the area of flexible films, carrageenans suffer from limitations that are primarily a result of their inherent hydrophilicity. Considerable research efforts have been devoted to the improvement of the properties of carrageenan films in order to extend the range of suitable applications.

However, contemporary living walls are cost prohibitive and made of materials with shorter life spans than their buildings. High cost often restricts their use to luxury applications promoting ecological symbolism rather than impactful propagation of urban nature. This study shows an approach to lowering living wall costs and increasing their use by integrating them into the building's structure. Existing living wall systems are hung like curtains from a building's façade; they are made as light as possible to reduce the weight they superimpose. Their lighter materials, e.g., felts and plastics, limit their life cycle. Conversely, combining the living function with the exterior envelope will match a living wall's life cycle to its building, and cost diminishes by eliminating a living wall's secondary support structure. This study focuses on concrete construction, a typology needing ecological evolution. Chosen for its ubiquity, durability, affordability, and plasticity, concrete was tested as a potential growing medium for plants. The result of the study is a new living concrete material and system aimed at advancing biophilic design in cities facing shifting climates and population densification. Presented are a new cast-in-place living wall system, a new concrete and its mechanical properties, verification of constructability, identification of plants suitable to cementitious environments, indoor germination and growth, full-scale tests of a new construction methodology, how concrete's chemical composition affects irrigation water, outdoor germination and perenniality, and a cost analysis showing a 50% reduction to the installed cost of living walls. Cost savings include plants grown from seed-in-situ (eliminating raising plants in a nursery and transplantation), and not using fertilizer (eliminating chemicals and a fertigation system). This study shows how rethinking the current living wall paradigm could shift the industry toward solutions to democratize living walls via lower cost and permanence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Construction system innovation; Green infrastructure; Green wall integrated systems; Living concrete; Living wall technologies","Cast in place concrete; Chemical analysis; Concrete testing; Cost benefit analysis; Cultivation; Durability; Ecology; Irrigation; Mechanical properties; Seed; Chemical compositions; Concrete materials; Construction systems; Green infrastructure; Integrated systems; New constructions; Secondary supports; Wall technologies; Walls (structural partitions); concrete; fertilizer; chemical composition; concrete; construction method; cost analysis; innovation; mechanical property; support structure; urban design; wall; architecture; Article; building; chemical composition; controlled study; cost control; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; fertigation; germination; greenhouse; irrigation (agriculture); living wall; mechanics; nonhuman; perennial plant; plant growth; plasticity; priority journal; urban area; building material; environmental protection; procedures; Conservation of Natural Resources; Construction Materials; Fertilizers","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85064180130",NA,NA

However, information on the actual contribution to climate change provided by sustainable food production systems is lacking in literature. With the intention to contribute to a more informed debate, this study aims at quantify the actual impact on climate of sustainable practices applied to a grape-to-wine system in Italy. The overall budget of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes is assessed at wine farm level, from the vineyard to the final bottle of wine, through an integration of methods, including the eddy covariance technique, the life cycle assessment (LCA) and the IPCC guidelines. All the components of the GHG budget have been considered: the (a) biogenic GHG fluxes and the (b) anthropogenic GHG emissions generated for the grape production as well as the (c) carbon stock change due to the vineyard management and the (d) anthropogenic GHG emissions generated by the transformation of grape into wine. At the vineyard level, the overall GHG budget resulted to be close to zero, showing a potential carbon neutrality of sustainable viticulture: the sum of biogenic GHG fluxes (a) and the carbon stock change (c) resulted in a net carbon sink with a potential contribution to climate change mitigation of −0,27 ± 1,11 Mg CO 2 eq year −1 per hectare; while the anthropogenic GHG emissions (b) for the sustainable vineyard management accounted for 0,24 ± 0,05 Mg CO 2 eq ha −1 year −1 . The total carbon footprint (b + d) of sustainable wine is 0,79 ± 0,14 kg CO 2 eq per bottle, with 15% attributable to the agricultural phase and 85% to the transformation of grape into wine. These findings indicate that sustainable wine production has in general a lower contribution to climate change. In particular, sustainable practices applied to viticulture can turn the system into a net carbon sink able to totally compensate the anthropogenic emissions for the vineyard management. Therefore, sustainable viticulture allows food production with a potential carbon neutrality without exacerbating climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Climate change mitigation; Eddy covariance; LCA; Vineyard; Wine","Agriculture; Bottles; Breweries; Budget control; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Food processing; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Magnesium; Sustainable development; Wine; Climate change mitigation; Comprehensive assessment; Eddy covariance; Eddy covariance technique; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Sustainable agricultural; Sustainable viticulture; Vineyard; Climate change","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85064212173",NA,NA

This could in part be attributable to a ‘Blue Planet effect’, but a bigger change in how the natural world is understood in public policy terms can also be observed, moving the natural environment from a niche conservationist concern, and a perceived resource drain, to a public good which contributes positively to the economy, public health and wellbeing of the nation as a whole. This paper is interested in what this change can tell us about the importance of public interest and perceptions of public benefit for the historic environment, as another conservationist policy concern. It hypothesises that despite the growing body of evidence about the positive social and economic value of heritage and place, ‘heritage’ has an association with white, and middle and upper class interests which limits its ability to be perceived as a potential policy solution for delivering wide public benefit, rather than a drain on resource. It concludes that creating a new perspective on heritage as a genuinely shared asset will be key to taking the next step for heritage on the public policy journey. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Heritage; public policy","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85071367989",NA,NA

Using sewage sludge compost and pig manure to partially substitute chemical fertilizer nitrogen may promote sustainable ecosystem services. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the values of associate ecosystem services with a unified standard. To comprehensively understand the effect of partial organic substitution on ecosystem services (supporting vegetable production and sequestering soil organic carbon) and ecosystem dis-services (greenhouse gas emissions and reactive nitrogen release), we attempted to evaluate the ecosystem service from the perspective of economic assessment. A field experiment was conducted in a peri-urban zone in eastern China, including the following six treatments at equal total nitrogen application rates: (1) no fertilizer nitrogen applied; (2) 25% sewage sludge compost substitution; (3) 25% pig manure substitution; (4) 50% sewage sludge compost substitution; (5) 50% pig manure substitution and (6) chemical fertilizer nitrogen only. The results showed that partial organic substitution significantly increased annual vegetable yield by 27.8%–35.3% and annual soil organic carbon sequestration rate by 129.2%–213.8%. Moreover, greenhouse gas emissions (methane and nitrous oxide) were significantly decreased by 28.6%–43.2%; nitrogen leaching and runoff were significantly decreased by 39.0%–49.5% and 26.8%–62.0%, respectively; and ammonia volatilization was increased by 2.4%–27.8%. Overall, partial substitution with organic fertilizer decreased total reactive nitrogen losses by 19.9%–39.8% compared with the 100% chemical fertilizer nitrogen treatment. Although additional labor and higher input costs were required, partial organic substitution could obtain a higher net economic benefit of 25198–90670 ¥ ha −1 yr −1 compared with the sole application of chemical fertilizer nitrogen. The results suggest that partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer can sustain ecosystem services and reduce ecosystem dis-services in the peri-urban zone and increase economic profits for farmers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gas emission; Net ecosystem economic benefits; Peri-urban zone; Reactive nitrogen releases; Vegetable production","Ammonia; Composting; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Mammals; Manures; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Sewage sludge; Vegetables; Water quality; Carbon sequestration; Economic benefits; Reactive nitrogen; Urban zones; Vegetable productions; Ecosystems","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85063960020",NA,NA

However to assess green spaces, attention is generally paid to local biodiversity (i.e. “in situ”)which concerns the plot on which buildings are constructed. The biodiversity impacted outside the construction site (i.e. “ex situ”)which concerns the extraction of materials, transportation and waste, is rarely associated to the project assessment. In this study, two endpoint Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)methods are applied: ReCiPe 2016 and Impact World + to assess a conventional roof and three different types of green roofs. As Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)data about urban plants are missing, we created new data to model the vegetation layer of green roofs by collecting information nearby plants nursery. This work shows that 1)extensive green roof generates the least biodiversity loss, 2)“ex situ” biodiversity is 10 times more impacted than “in situ” biodiversity, 3)the impact of the vegetation layer on the biodiversity loss is significant. LCA methods do not enable to cover all pressures threatening biodiversity and they also lack precision to assess “in situ” biodiversity. Nevertheless, their main strength is to consider “ex situ” biodiversity along the value chain of the studied systems. Coupling LCA with ecological expertise should improve the assessment by taking into account local specificities and both negative and positive impacts of a system (e.g. “in situ” biodiversity gains with green roofs). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Green roofs; Life cycle assessment; Urban plants life cycle inventories","Ecosystems; Life cycle; Materials handling; Roofs; Vegetation; Construction sites; Ecological expertise; Extensive green roofs; Green roof; Impact assessments; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle inventories; Life Cycle Inventory; Biodiversity; assessment method; biodiversity; building construction; ecosystem service; greenspace; life cycle analysis; plant; roof; urban area","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85065545516",NA,NA

The results from the estimation of the enrichment factors (EF) showed that Pb is the heavy metal with the highest values, followed by the Zn, Cu and Cr. The EF obtained for all heavy metals show that there is a moderate to high anthropogenic enrichment. The above indicates that in the MZTV there are emission sources that contribute (significantly) in the amount of Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn accumulated in the biomonitor. Combustion processes, vehicle emissions, biomass burning, brick kiln emissions, agricultural and livestock activities, manufacturing industry and re-deposition by the action of the wind, were identified as the main heavy metals sources in the MZTV.

The total agrochemical residue (TR) caused by main agrochemical inputs was estimated in the study area of Qinghai province and the Tibet Autonomous Region over 1995-2017 by using the emergy synthesis method. The total agrochemical residue was decomposed into the intensity factor, the structure factor, the productivity factor, and the labour factor by using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method. The change in TR could be divided into four time periods, i.e., a rapidly increasing period during 1995-1998, a stable period during 1999-2004, a slowly increasing period during 2005-2011, and a fluctuant period during 2012-2017. The study area had a mean TR intensity in area (TRA) of 3.31 × 1014 sej/ha, which was only 38.21% of that in China; however, the annual growth rate of TRA in the study area was 2.93%, higher than the rate of 1.91% in China over 1995-2017. The study area had a mean TR intensity in production (TRP) of 4.06 × 1010 sej/CNY (Chinese Yuan), which was 71.05% of that in China; however, the annual decreasing rate of TRP in the study area was 0.95%, lower than the rate of 1.98% in China over 1995-2017. All the LMDI decomposed factors contributed to the TR increase during 1995-1998; the intensity factor, the structure factor, and the labour factor contributed to the TR decrease during 1999-2004; the structure factor and the productivity factor contributed to the TR increase during 2005-2011; and only the productivity factor contributed to the TR increase during 2012-2017. Compared with the whole country, the study area has more potential to reduce TR by improving agrochemical use efficiency, strengthening the recovery of plastic film residue, increasing organic agricultural materials, raising the efficiency of agricultural production, and accelerating the transfer of rural labours to secondary and tertiary industries. © 2019 by the authors.","Agricultural policies; Agrochemical inputs; Agrochemical residues; Emergy synthesis; LMDI decomposition; The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau","agricultural policy; agricultural production; agrochemical; decomposition analysis; emergy; growth rate; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85068719439",NA,NA

On the other hand, value recovery from e-waste offers significant economic benefits due to the valuable metals in e-waste, such as precious and base metals. Many developed countries have employed effective e-waste management strategies and state-of-art recycling technologies, such as integrated pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical smelters to manage this waste stream sustainably and extract the maximum value components from this secondary resource. This has not been the case in most of the developing countries and e-waste management is still in its infancy. The value recovery operations have been informal and semi-formal without incorporating required waste disposal strategies. Addressing this current socio-environmental issue, especially in developing countries, has been significant to achieve some of the United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11), responsible production and consumption (Goal 12), and life below water (Goal 14), by 2030 (The United Nations: Sustainable development goals, 2018).

We compiled anthropogenic threats to fish biodiversity in a hierarchical meta-analysis, along with an evidence synthesis of threats related to biological invasions, based on peer-reviewed research with the aim to represent the actual conservation status of the South American ichthyofauna. We highlighted human-related threats and synergistic effects of biological invasions, climate change, environmental alterations (e.g., pollution, aquaculture and damming) and fisheries. Considering measures that reinforce novel alien fish (e.g., artificial hybrids or genetically modified) introductions, it became clear why an eventual increase in local or regional species richness is not always beneficial to aquaculture, biodiversity, human well-being or nature. In fact, citizens in all societal roles, including scientists, should revise their concepts about threats to fish biodiversity. Environmental policies require more than taxonomic diagnostics to achieve conservation goals under an incompatible scenario of a multiplying number of fish species and biotic homogenization. We advocate for countries in South America using science-based strategies useful to maintain their social and economic growth along with their “remaining nature.” We live a crucial moment when the government overlooks threats to biodiversity and uses agribusiness as the most acceptable manner of fuelling the economy. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Anthropocene; anthropogenic disturbance; fish conservation; global change; invasion science; negative effects","agroindustry; Anthropocene; biodiversity; conservation status; economic growth; global change; ichthyofauna; invasive species; meta-analysis; species richness; taxonomy; Homo sapiens","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85064501612",NA,NA

There is an obvious need for studies to assess the extent to which plastic debris affects the Pacific. Therefore, this research aims to address this need by undertaking a systematic assessment of the ecological and health impacts of plastic debris on Pacific islands. Using pertinent historical qualitative and quantitative data of the distribution of plastic debris in the region, this study identified pollution and contamination trends and risks to ecosystems, and suggests some measures which may be deployed to address the identified problems. The study illustrates the fact that Pacific Island States are being disproportionately affected by plastic, and reiterates that further studies and integrated strategies are needed, involving public education and empowerment, governmental action, as well as ecologically sustainable industry leadership. It is also clear that more research is needed in respect of developing alternatives to conventional plastic, by the production of bio-plastic, i.e. plastic which is produced from natural (e.g. non-fossil fuel-based sources) materials, and which can be fully biodegradable. © 2019","Environment; Health; Pacific; Plastic debris; Pollution; Waste","Debris; Health; Pollution; Risk assessment; Wastes; Environment; Health implications; Integrated strategy; Pacific; Plastic debris; Quantitative data; Sustainable industries; Systematic assessment; Biodegradable polymers; ecological impact; health impact; plastic waste; pollution effect; qualitative analysis; risk assessment; trend analysis; article; contamination; ecosystem; education; empowerment; human; human experiment; leadership; Pacific islands; quantitative analysis; animal; environmental monitoring; Pacific islands; waste; water pollutant; Pacific islands; plastic; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pacific Islands; Plastics; Waste Products; Water Pollutants","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85063761068",NA,NA

The World Economic Forum, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and McKinsey & Company claimed in 2016 that technological innovations can solve the plastic problem. Such a claim raises an as yet unanswered question: how much technological innovation is needed and is it economically feasible? We offer answers to this question via a system dynamics model that we developed to simulate different scenarios aimed at controlling plastic debris entering the global ocean. Our results show that ocean cleanup technologies could achieve a 25% reduction in the level of plastic debris in the ocean below 2010 levels in 2030. However, this would require removing 15% of the stock of plastic debris from the ocean every year over the period 2020–2030, which equates to 135 million tons of plastic in total (metric tons). The implementation cost of such an ocean cleanup effort would amount to €492 billion-€708 billion, which represents 0.7%–1.0% of the world GDP in 2017 – this calculation is based on unit costs in €/kg estimated in The Ocean Cleanup project feasibility study. The Ocean Cleanup project alone is designed to collect 70,320 tons of plastic debris over a 10 year period. Removing 135 million tons of plastic debris would require investing in 1924 similar cleanup projects. These results help to assess the economic feasibility of removing such large volume of plastics. Moreover, our results provide quantitative confirmation that technological solutions alone are not sufficient to solve plastic pollution issues. A portfolio of diverse solutions – not only technological ones – is likely to have greater technical, political and economic feasibility. Our model shows that such a combined portfolio implemented over the period 2020–2030 could reduce the ocean plastic stock to 2013 levels (94 million tons) by 2030. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Decoupling GDP; Marine ecosystem; Marine litter; Ocean cleanup; System dynamics; Waste management","Aquatic ecosystems; Debris; Economic analysis; Ecosystems; Elastomers; Oceanography; System theory; Waste management; Decoupling GDP; Economic feasibilities; Marine litter; Ocean cleanup; Plastic contamination; System Dynamics; Technological innovation; Technological solution; Biodegradable polymers; Gross Domestic Product; innovation; marine ecosystem; marine pollution; plastic; waste management; Article; biodegradability; calculation; cleaning; contamination; cost; environmental impact; environmental protection; feasibility study; plastic waste; priority journal; quantitative analysis; sea pollution; technology; waste component removal; waste management","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85063256948",NA,NA

As an important component of the biogeochemical cycle, carbon flows through various natural and artificial processes. Therefore, carbon can be used as a research vector to explore the relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being. This study proposed a method for a quantitative assessment of “ecosystem services-human well-being” based on carbon flows. The assessment of the changes in ecosystem services and human well-being based on carbon in the Manas River Basin from 1990 to 2015 revealed the complex relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being. The results were as follows: (1) The development of ecosystem services was uneven, with increasing provisioning services and decreasing regulating, supporting and cultural services. (2) The basic materials for a good life and health in human well-being showed an upward trend, and the security indicator showed a downward trend. (3) The indicators of the basic materials for a good life and health were significantly positively correlated with provisioning services and were significantly negatively correlated with the other three services. Moreover, the internal structure of the security and health indicators were malformed. (4) Over time, the impact of provisioning services on the well-being indicators has gradually weakened, and the influence of regulating, supporting and cultural services has continually increased. In general, this study evaluated the complex relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being through carbon flow quantification, which can not only unify the dimensions for comparison, but also eliminate the impact of subjective factors to achieve a scientific nature. It is not only helpful to provide theoretical and practical basis for scientific management of Manas River Basin, but also to explore a larger scale and a wider area in the world through selecting indicators according to local conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon flow; Ecosystem services; Human well-being; The Manas River Basin","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85064970766",NA,NA

Faced with limited environmental resources for food production, issues related to food loss and waste are critical in mitigating challenges stemming from projected population growth and long-term food security and sustainability. The potential for using insects to consume organic waste materials and convert them into feed for animal, biofuels, and other valuable secondary products is gaining momentum as both a research discipline and as a business opportunity. Here, this ecosystem service is referred to as “insects as bioconverters of organic waste.” Scientific reviews of this topic have mainly focused on the challenges associated with development of commercial scale systems. To compliment existing reviews, we address this exciting topic from an artificial selection perspective, as we review and discuss aspects associated with targeted breeding and adaptation of both gut microbial communities and host insects themselves. We describe the “ideal insect bioconverter,” insects uniquely equipped to convert wastes into biomass and other valuable secondary products, and we present the current knowledge and existing research gaps towards the development of such organisms. We conclude that (1) targeted breeding of insects and their gut microbes can produce tailored insect lineages for bioconversion of specific waste streams; (2) research is needed to take full advantage of the existing insect diversity to identify new candidate species for bioconversion; and (3) further research into insect-gut microbial complexes will likely provide important insight into ways insects can be used as sustainable bioconverters of highly specialized waste streams. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptive plasticity; Bioconversion; Breeding; Entomophagy; Food waste; Industrial entomology; Microbiome; Organic residues; Sustainable agriculture","adaptive management; alternative agriculture; ecosystem service; entomology; food production; food security; food waste; industrial technology; insect; literature review; microorganism; organic compound; phenotypic plasticity; plant breeding; population growth; sustainability; waste management; waste technology; Animalia; Hexapoda","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85065652706",NA,NA

However, constructed wetlands used for marine aquaculture effluent treatments are understudied when compared to their freshwater counterpart. We compared the nutrient retention and the microbial communities of two types of constructed wetland mesocosms, a vertical-flow treatment wetland (VFTW) and floating treatment wetland (FTW) in subtropical south Florida. To enhance nutrient retention efficiency, we implemented biodegradable plastic (polycaprolactone), as an external carbon source and monitored the performance of VFTW and FTW for the treatment of marine aquaculture effluent. Polycaprolactone surface were covered by various cyanobacterial genera including Oscillatoria, Leptolyngbya, Brasilonema, and Trichormus and some plastic-degrading bacteria such as Pseudomonas. The presence of a biodegradable plastic in FTW improved the overall performance of nitrogen removal (nitrite plus nitrate) by 14% through denitrification. The pattern of nutrient removal between two treatment wetland mesocosms were significantly different (p < 0.01), with over 87–91% retention of total nitrogen in VFTW and no retention in FTW, the latter due to poor retention of nitrite plus nitrate and production of organic nitrogen from the system not present in inflow waters. Total phosphorus was retained in both mesocosm types, with higher retention (74–81%) in the VFTW than in the FTW (17–40%). The nutrient retention in VFTW was higher overall compared with FTW mesocosms regardless of biodegradable plastic presence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aquaculture; Biodegradable plastic; Floating treatment wetland; Microbial community; Vertical-flow treatment wetland","Agricultural runoff; Aquaculture; Bacteria; Biodegradable polymers; Biodegradation; Efficiency; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Nitrates; Nutrients; Plastics; Water pollution; Water quality; Wetlands; Biodegradable plastics; Constructed wetlands; Degrading bacteria; Floating treatment wetlands; Marine aquaculture; Microbial communities; Treatment wetland mesocosms; Vertical flows; Nitrogen removal; agricultural runoff; aquaculture effluent; bacterium; constructed wetland; freshwater environment; microbial community; organic nitrogen; plastic; pollutant removal; polymer; subtropical region; water quality; Florida [United States]; United States; Cyanobacteria; Leptolyngbya; Oscillatoria; Pseudomonas; Trichormus","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85063232401",NA,NA

Important political and technical challenges are involved, especially with respect to landfilled waste. Plastic is popular and, notwithstanding decrease policies, it will remain a material widely used in most economic sectors. However, questions of plastic waste recycling in the contemporary world cannot be solved without knowing the material, which can be achieved by careful sampling, analysis and quantification. Plastic is heterogeneous, but usually all plastic waste is jointly handled for recycling and incineration. Separation before processing waste through the analytical approach must be applied. Modern landfill mining and site clean-up projects in contemporary waste management systems require comprehensive material studies ranging from the macro-characterization of waste masses to a more detailed analysis of hazardous constituents and properties from an energy calorific standpoint—where, among other methods, thermogravimetric research coupled with life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic assessment is highly welcomed. © 2019 by the authors.

This study is focused on the luxury furniture industry and it is aimed at investigating how much furniture companies know about Circular Economy practices, what they specifically do for implementing them and what factors motivate, support or hinder their adoption. The role of product and process certifications in developing such sustainable practices is also analyzed, given their importance for implementing environmentally sustainable practices. The research method is based on a qualitative multiple case study carried out on four Italian companies operating in the luxury furniture industry. A worthy degree of awareness and knowledge of Circular Economy principles emerged from the analysis. Nevertheless, furniture companies analyzed are still little involved in Circular Economy practices, especially concerning reuse and recycle actions, which are particularly important within this perspective. Similarly, very little use of process and product certifications emerged from the study. Therefore, a potential gap seems to arise between the positive attitude towards Circular Economy practices and their actual implementation, which suggests useful implications for both institutions and managers involved in sustainable development processes. © 2019 by the authors.","Circular economy; Italy; Luxury furniture; Quality management; Sustainability","business development; economic analysis; knowledge; manufacturing; quality control; research method; sustainability; sustainable development; timber industry; wood quality; Italy","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85067310108",NA,NA

An effective solution to this problem is the use of ecological compensation to encourage rural households to adopt agricultural pollution control measures. This study aims to answer two questions: How much compensation should be given to encourage rural households in water source areas to participate in ANSP control? What factors will influence their participation? In this study, paddy rice planting in water source area has been used as an example aiming to answer these questions. This study used the random parameter logit (RPL) model with survey data from 632 rural households in the Qinba water source area to empirically analyze rural households' willingness to accept compensation for ANSP control and the influencing factors of this willingness. From this information, the compensation standards for ANSP control in a water source area were calculated. The results show that (1) compensation had a significant incentive effect on rural households' willingness to control ANSP. The marginal compensation standard for reducing the use of fertilizer and pesticide was $3.40/ha and $2.00/ha, respectively. The compensation standard for not applying chemical fertilizer and pesticide at all was $540.23/ha. (2) There was heterogeneity in rural households' preference for ANSP control compensation policies. Rural households characterized by younger residents, higher family income, higher perception of the ecological benefits, and higher perception of government policy were more willing to participate in the compensation policy. It is suggested that rural households showed a strong preference for ANSP control policies by considering both of their economic losses and ecological benefits. Our study contributes to the literature by enriching the evaluation method in providing references for the compensation of ANSP control policies. © 2019 by the authors.","Agricultural non-point source pollution control; Choice experiment; Compensation standard; Water source area","Agriculture; Fertilizers; Losses; Pesticides; Water pollution; Water pollution control; Agricultural non-point source pollutions; Agricultural pollution; Chemical fertilizers; Choice experiments; Compensation standards; Ecological compensation; Water source areas; Willingness to accept; Rural areas; agricultural emission; discrete choice analysis; environmental economics; fertilizer application; household structure; nonpoint source pollution; perception; pollution control; rural society; standard (regulation); water pollution; willingness to pay","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85068846587",NA,NA

A set of indicators suitable for the future assessment of this pressure needs to be proposed. Thirty-six topsoil samples (0–5 cm) were collected from roadsides in a suburban region of Bishkek, the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic in Central Asia, and a risk assessment of anthropogenically disturbed potentially toxic elements (PTEs) was systematically conducted with classic statistical methods. The results of detrended correspondence analysis and principal component analysis clearly showed that topsoil samples with high contents of PTEs (Pb, Zn and Cu) were strongly affected by traffic within a distance threshold of 200 m and that anthropogenic effects decreased significantly with increasing distance from the highway. The enrichment factor and anthropogenic contribution for Pb were the highest among the three PTEs, with average values of 2.0% and 47.4%, respectively, suggesting enrichment. However, the results of the human health risk assessment also indicated that noncarcinogenic risks did not occur for any of the anthropogenic PTEs. The reported method provides a new systematic pathway to reveal anthropogenic influences on the geochemical composition of soil. The conclusions of this work will be highly valuable as important guidelines for agriculture, and the results of the PTE contents will provide a scientific basis for soil collection in future studies. © 2018 British Society of Soil Science","anthropogenic factors; Central Asia; human health risk; potentially toxic elements; roadside soils","anthropogenic effect; correspondence analysis; geochemistry; health risk; principal component analysis; public health; risk assessment; roadside environment; suburban area; topsoil; toxic material; Central Asia; Kyrgyzstan","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85064506338",NA,NA

Nitrogen being the main mineral element required for plant growth, has led to the extensive use of chemical fertilizers causing nitrogen pollution of the ecosystems. This field study investigates the use of biogas residues (BRs) as biofertilizers and their contribution to the mitigation of nitrate leaching in agricultural soils, while also demonstrating the polluting nature of chemical fertilizers. Nine different fertilization treatments classified in three schemes and two nitrogen doses were tested for three consecutive years on a grassland in the Walloon Region of Belgium. Residual soil mineral nitrogen, percentage contribution of treatments in residual nitrate and agronomic performance were assessed for each fertilization treatment. The results obtained showed significant differences on treatment and scheme level regarding nitrate accumulation in the soil, with chemical fertilizers posing the highest nitrate leaching risk. BRs did not cause nitrate accumulation in the soil, and were N rate and rainfall independent, while the chemical treatments indicated a cumulative tendency under high N rate and low precipitation. Forage yield did not demonstrate statistical differences on treatment and scheme level but varied with changing precipitation, while the maximum application rate suggested a plateau. Aboveground nitrogen content was significantly higher after the application of chemical fertilizers only in the first year, while all the chemical treatments indicated a dilution effect under elevated annual rainfall. Finally, the partial substitution of chemical fertilizers by raw digestate reduced the concentration of NO 3 − in the soil without having a negative impact on the yield and N content of the biomass. These results strongly advocate for the environmental benefits of BRs over chemical fertilizers and underline their suitability as biofertilizers and substitutes for chemical fertilizers in similar agricultural systems. © 2019","Agricultural pollution; Agronomic performance; Anaerobic digestion; Biofertilizers; Nitrate leaching; Nutrient recycling","Agronomy; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Leaching; Nitrates; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nutrients; Rain; Soils; Agricultural pollution; Agronomic performance; Biofertilizers; Nitrate leaching; Nutrient recycling; Soil pollution; biogas; chemical fertilizer; fertilizer; mineral; nitrate; nitrogen; rain; unclassified drug; biofuel; fertilizer; nitric acid derivative; agricultural land; anaerobic digestion; biofertilizer; biogas; comparative study; leaching; nitrate; nutrient cycling; soil pollution; agriculture; Article; Belgium; biomass; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; forage yield; grassland; nitrate leaching; nonhuman; precipitation; priority journal; soil pollution; analysis; ecosystem restoration; grassland; procedures; soil pollutant; Belgium; Wallonia; Belgium; Biofuels; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Fertilizers; Grassland; Nitrates; Soil Pollutants","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85061810945",NA,NA

The discourse on circular economy emphasizes the role of durable products, while consumable products are less in focus, although resources efficiency is needed for all types of products. This paper aims to contribute knowledge on resource efficient measures that are possible to implement for consumables and to evaluate their resource efficiency potential by means of a case study on incontinence products using life cycle assessment. Four possible measures were identified that can be implemented at different stages of the value-chain, to increase their resource efficiency. The study was delimited to measures possible to implement using current technology. The measures were: recycling of waste generated in production, increasing the share of bio-based material in the product, shifting to a partly reusable product system and more effective use of products through customization to user's needs. Effective use of products through customization led to at least 20% decrease in environmental impact with no trade-offs between studied impact categories. However, when looking at global warming potential only, the partly reusable product system was found to decrease environmental impact with more than 50% compared to a corresponding disposable product. Moreover, many resource efficient measures were identified as being possible to implement for consumables, and in the case of incontinence products a combination of measures was possible. © 2019 The Authors","Circular economy; Consumables; Incontinence products; Life cycle assessment; Resource efficiency","Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Global warming; Circular economy; Consumables; Incontinence products; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Resource efficiencies; Life cycle; carbon; carbon dioxide; natural gas; petroleum; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; recycling; waste management; absorption; Article; biodiversity; biomass; climate change; controlled study; electricity; environmental impact; environmental protection; fossil; greenhouse effect; hospital waste; incineration; life cycle assessment; recycling; soil quality; waste disposal","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85059956411",NA,NA

The result shows damaged land around the Longchi coal mine is most suitable for being reclaimed as woodland. The main restrictive factors are the degree of contamination of the soil and water and the irrigation conditions. This study provides a basis for the rational reutilization and improvement options of damaged land around Long Chi coal mine.

The transformation of areas underused, such as urban rooftops, into productive spaces is being increasingly implemented as a result of associated multiple benefits. Rooftop greenhouses (RTGs) are an interesting option for exploiting urban rooftops with direct exposure to sunlight, reducing food miles and creating new agricultural spaces, while building-applied solar photovoltaic (BAPV) panels provide clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, a proper assessment of environmental costs and benefits related to both systems is vital for a successful implementation. By means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, modelled in the professional software SimaPro, this paper aims at comparing the environmental performance of different productive uses of rooftops under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The results showed that both systems are favourable and contribute to decreasing the environmental impacts thanks to the production of resources on-site. BAPV system shows the highest avoided burdens in comparison with RTG: for instance, the impacts generated by BAPV on climate change and fossil depletion categories, corresponding to - 430 kg CO2 eq/m2 and - 110 kg oil eq/m2 respectively (versus - 22 kg CO2 eq/m2 and - 4.7 kg oil eq/m2 in the RTG system), are around 20 times lower than RTG. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed through different scenarios, based on reductions or substitution of the most sensitive input flows, thus providing some useful tools for improved environmental performances. Attention to additional energy and material efficiency, in favour of the more environmentally sustainable choice, should remain a main point of investigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","agri-urban; circular economy; cities; LCA; photovoltaic energy; rooftop","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Oils and fats; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Urban growth; agri-urban; Circular economy; cities; Photovoltaic energy; rooftop; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; agricultural production; life cycle analysis; photovoltaic system; public space; roof; solar power; sustainability; urban design; urban development; agricultural procedures; Article; climate change; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; energy yield; environmental factor; fossil; greenhouse; life cycle assessment; light exposure; photovoltaic energy generation; resource management; sensitivity analysis; software; Southern Europe; sunlight; sustainable development; urbanization","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85061434365",NA,NA

FM consists of particulate matter of natural (e.g. wood, branches, leaves, seeds) and anthropogenic (e.g. plastic, human waste) origin as well as of organisms that, due to its properties, is able to float on the water surface. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the FM cycle and the fundamental environmental functions FM provides along rivers. Indeed, FM serves as an important geomorphological agent, a dispersal vector for animals and plant propagules, a habitat, a resource, and a biogeochemical component. Furthermore, we collected data on the amount of FM accumulating at dams and in reservoirs, and related it to key characteristics of the respective catchments. River fragmentation truncates the natural dynamics of FM through its extraction at damming structures, alteration in the flow regime, and low morphological complexity, which may decrease FM retention. Finally, we identify key knowledge gaps in relation to the role FM plays in supporting river integrity, and briefly discuss FM management strategies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Catchment management; Dispersal vector; Fragmentation; Geomorphological agent; Habitat; Resource function","anthropogenic source; catchment; data acquisition; dispersal; ecological approach; environmental management; fragmentation; geomorphology; particulate matter; river; Animalia","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85060313338",NA,NA

Various ecosystem services provided by termites – their importance as a food resource for humans, wildlife and domestic animals – are discussed, along with the use of these insects in scientific research and in folk and traditional medicine. Some insufficiently studied properties of termites (their ability to perceive the radiation of radioactive substances, electric fields and magnetic fields), as well as the use of termites in bionics, are described. Special attention is paid to the use of termite mounds for different purposes (e.g. in mineral deposit searches, in medical applications, as furnaces for copper smelting, for storage of some nuts, as burial sites, for gathering of edible mushrooms of the genus Termitomyces and as fertilizer). Examples of such use in different countries are given. This article reviews the activities of termites as pests of agriculture and forestry, including crops that are most affected, and termites as structural pests (e.g. wooden structures, household furniture, books and museum collections). Examples of termites’ malicious activities in different parts of the world are provided.

The continuation of high consumption of fossil fuels triggers climate change, while important metal ore deposits may be depleted within the near future. This situation requires a new kind of solution. For this purpose, the Ecopoint concept is proposed for the limitation of the consumption of fossil fuels and abiotic other non-renewable resources, as well as the land used to produce renewable ones. In this concept, the world’s population is provided with resource shares (Ecopoints) that are used for purchasing products containing virgin resources. Using the polym-erization of high density polyethylene as an example, it is shown that the Ecopoints concept favours options like sugar-based biomass (sweet sorghum, sugarcane, sugar beet) as a feedstock for bioethanol derived ethylene and waste materials (waste plastic, municipal solid waste) as a feedstocks for ethylene derived from cracking or gasification/Fischer-Tropsch synthesis over the conventional use of fossil fuel derived ethylene. © 2018 Cisa Publisher.","Biomass; Decarbonization; Ecopoints; Fossil fuel; Polyethylene; Resource shares; Trade-off","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85087801352",NA,NA

In tropical forests, for example, seeds defecated by mammals that are subsequently buried by dung beetles are less likely to suffer predation. While the effects of dung beetles on the fate of defecated seeds have been relatively well studied, their effect on seeds already buried in the soil has not. To contribute to fill this gap, we designed a study with three objectives: (a) Describe the vertical re-distribution of soil seeds that occurs due to dung beetle activity; (b) Determine if beetle activity favors establishment of seedlings from the soil seed bank; and (c) Determine if the effect of dung beetles is stronger in sites of recurrent mammal defecation. We carried out three complementary field experiments, one with artificial seeds (plastic beads) of three sizes buried at known depths, one with two species of seeds buried at those same depths, and one with the natural soil seed bank in sites of single vs. recurrent defecation. Buried beads were moved by dung beetles along the vertical axis, both upwards (9.5%) and downwards (11.5%); smaller beads were more frequently moved downwards while the contrary occurred for larger beads. Dung beetle activity caused an increase in seedling establishment, both from experimentally buried seeds and from the natural seed bank. Defecation recurrence had no effect on seedling establishment. We conclude that dung beetle activity affects seed bank dynamics with important consequences for seedling establishment in tropical forests.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material. © 2019 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","biotic interactions; Los Tuxtlas; Mexico; Scarabaeinae; seed burial; tropical rain forest","beetle; predation; rainforest; seed bank; seedling establishment; tropical forest; Los Tuxtlas; Mexico [North America]; Veracruz; Coleoptera; Mammalia; Scarabaeinae; Vertebrata","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85062364164",NA,NA

In addition, economic growth and dietary shifts towards animal source foods have put high pressure and demand on agricultural production. The high ecological footprint of meat and dairy production, as well as high feed costs, prevent the livestock sector from meeting the increasing demand in a sustainable manner. Insects such as the black soldier fly (BSF) have been identified as potential alternatives to the conventionally used protein sources in livestock feed due to their rich nutrient content and the fact that they can be reared on organic side streams. Substrates derived from organic byproducts are suitable for industrial large-scale production of insect meal. Although efficient in waste management and in feed production, BSF larvae are very sensitive to the external environment such as temperature and rearing medium. Therefore, we studied the effect of temperature and substrate type, i.e., brewers’ spent grain (SG) and cow dung (CD), on the development and survival of BSF larvae. Both organic substrates were readily available in Nairobi, Kenya, the location of the experiments. In our experiment, 100 3–5-day-old BSF larvae were placed into containers that contained either SG or CD and further treated at temperatures of 15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, and 35 °C. The duration of larval development was recorded, and the prepupae were removed, weighed, and placed individually in separate, labeled, 35-mL plastic cups filled with moist sawdust. After emergence, 10 2-day-old adults (5 males and 5 females) from every replica per substrate were transferred into a cage (40 × 40 × 40 cm) and allowed to mate for 24 h at their respective temperatures. The laid egg batches were collected and counted, and the adult flies’ longevity was recorded. The data were subjected to a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the general linear model procedure. BSF larvae reared on SG developed faster than those reared on CD; the former also favored higher temperatures for their larval development and emergence into adults. The optimum range was 25–30 °C. With increasing temperatures, the longevity of adult BSF decreased, while the fecundity of females increased. Thus, it is possible to take advantage of the readily available SG waste streams in the urban environments of Kenya to produce BSF larvae-derived livestock feed within a short duration of time and at relatively high temperatures. © 2019 by the authors.

Here, soils were collected from 13 greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) farms or bases near industrial areas in the Yangtze River Delta of China to investigate the occurrence, speciation, and risks of Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni, and Pb in GVP soil. The results revealed that the main metal elements causing GVP soil pollution were Cd, Zn, Ni, and Cu, of which contamination levels were generally unpolluted to moderately polluted. Zinc pollution was mainly attributed to heavy fertilization, while Cd, Ni, and Cu pollution may be greatly ascribed to industrial effluents and coal combustion. Metal speciation studies showed that most of Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn was present in residual fraction while more than half of Cd and Pb was present in non-residual fractions. Additionally, pollution of Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn in GVP soil increased their corresponding mobile fractions. Risk assessment using potential ecological risk index and risk assessment code showed that Cd was the major risk contributor. Specifically, Cd generally posed moderate or considerable ecological risk as well as displayed medium or high mobility risk in GVP soil. Thus, great attention should be paid to the contribution of both industrial discharges and intensive farming to soil pollution by trace metals, especially Cd, because of its high mobility risk. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","BCR procedure; Greenhouse vegetable production soil; Industrial areas; Risk assessment; Trace metals","agricultural land; coal combustion; concentration (composition); crop production; developing world; environmental risk; industrial waste; risk assessment; soil pollution; speciation (chemistry); trace metal; vegetable; China; Yangtze River; heavy metal; trace element; agricultural land; agriculture; analysis; China; ecology; environmental monitoring; growth, development and aging; industry; pollution; risk assessment; river; soil; soil pollutant; vegetable; Agriculture; China; Ecology; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Farms; Industry; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trace Elements; Vegetables","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85060993774",NA,NA

An experiment was conducted for three consecutive seasons from 2013 to 2016, to study the effect of no straw (S0), S1/2 (700 kg/ha soybean straw, and 3000 kg/ha wheat straw), and S1 (1400 kg ha−1 soybean straw, and 6000 kg/ha wheat straw) treatments in wheat-soybean multi-crop system. The randomized complete block design was used with three repeats. Compared with the S0 regime, a significant increase of 0.5%–8.7% and 1.4%–27.7% in soil CO2 emission was observed in the S1 regime during all growth stages of summer soybean and winter wheat, respectively. Soil temperature of S1/2 and S1 was 0.1–1.1 °C and 0.3–1.4 °C higher than that of S0 during the seeding stage and greening stage for wheat, during 2013 to 2016. During wheat season, soil moisture was higher in the S1 than in the S0 treatment. Likewise, wheat, soybean crop resulted the same results. Soil CO2 emissions increase with the increasing in soil temperature, and 73.4–73.9% of the variation could be explained by seasonal variation in soil temperature in wheat season. Similarly, 69.5–74.7% of the variation in soil CO2 emissions is recorded by seasonal variation in soil temperature in summer soybean season. Meanwhile (S1) increased the SOC and grain yield of wheat and soybean when compared to S0. Straw input increasing soil CO2, grain yield and SOC content, considering the benefits of straw inputs to crops yield and SOC content, It is concluded that the addition of straw improve agriculture production. However, the types of straw inputs in order to promote the sequestration of soil organic carbon with the decrease in greenhouse gas emission is the future research direction for agriculture development in Guanzhong region of China. © 2018","Grain yield; SOC content; Soil CO2 emissions; Straw mulching; Straw return","Carbon dioxide; Crops; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Straw; Temperature; Agriculture development; Agriculture productions; CO2 emissions; Future research directions; Grain yield; Soil carbon dioxide; Soil organic carbon; Straw mulching; Grain (agricultural product); carbon dioxide; organic carbon; water; carbon dioxide; water; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; crop residue; crop yield; mulching; semiarid region; soil organic matter; soil temperature; soil water; straw; water content; agriculture; Article; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; grain yield; growth curve; harvest; nonhuman; plant growth; plant seed; priority journal; seasonal variation; semiarid climate; soil moisture; soil temperature; soil water content; soybean; summer; wheat; winter; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; crop; growth, development and aging; maize; procedures; soil; temperature; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; China; Crops, Agricultural; Soil; Soybeans; Temperature; Triticum; Water; Zea mays","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85055279061",NA,NA

Specifically, in the field of earthworks, the amounts of materials can be massive and pose the crucial problem of resource shortage. Therefore, the reuse of excavated urban soils from foundation layers as new earthwork construction materials appears to be a sustainable and promising solution. Before repurposing, a better knowledge of urban soils and their potential pollutant load is compulsory. Materials and methods: In this paper, two soils excavated from the town of Paris are studied. After the stripping of their surface, to remove organic matter and surface pollution, the matrixes were submitted to elemental analyses using ICP-OES, C/S measurements, and XRF techniques. The elemental analyses were carried out on the whole materials, on three granulometric fractions (< 80 μm, 80–400 μm, > 400 μm) and on the families of artifacts (i.e., construction and demolition wastes, natural gravel, industrial wastes, magnetic, and non-magnetic slags) found in the soils. The combination of elemental analyses and a least absolute residual (LAR) procedure were used to quantify artifact contributions in all granulometric fractions. Results and discussion: The soils exhibit evidence of anthropic inputs with high contents of pollutants under the forms of carbonaceous, sulfur mineral and metallic alloys. Carbonaceous and trace pollutions are concentrated in magnetic and non-magnetic slags, while sulfur and strontium pollutions are concentrated in gypsum components. In both cases, all the granulometric fractions (including whole material) can be retrieved as a combination of artifact composition, suggesting that the Technosols mainly result from the mixture of these artifacts. The amounts of natural material, gypsum components, and magnetic slags increase with the fineness of the fractions. In contrary, the amount of non-magnetic slags decrease with the fineness of the fractions and suggests that the processes of slag weathering are not similar: carbonaceous slags are more stable than iron-enriched slags. Conclusions: The elemental analyses of granulometric fractions of soils and the artifacts using LAR analyses help in identifying the compositions of each granulometric fraction and give insight into the evolution of artifacts in the soil. These tools are also promising regarding the assessment of geo-environmental characteristics of urban soils, which in turn provides relevant information regarding management and reuse. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon; Construction and demolition wastes; Excavated soils; Least absolute regression; Sulfur; Trace elements; Urban soils","chemical analysis; construction material; demolition; excavation; granular medium; identification method; soil analysis; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil pollution; sorting; sulfur; trace element; urban area; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85049576776",NA,NA

The paper uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of onshore and offshore wind turbines with the nominal capacity of 2 MW, to advance our understanding of onshore and offshore wind energy and to inform policy, planning, and investment decisions for future growth of wind power. Results show that the life-cycle GHG emission intensity is 0.082 kg CO2-equivalent (eq)/Megajoule (MJ) for onshore wind turbine and is 0.130 kg CO2-eq/MJ for offshore wind turbine, respectively. Offshore wind turbine has larger life-cycle GHG emissions than onshore wind turbine, owing to the floating platform fixed in sea. Onshore and offshore wind turbines have much smaller life-cycle GHG emission intensity than coal power plants. If the installed wind turbines in 2014 displace coal, the saved GHG emissions can roughly reach 5.08 × 107 t CO2-eq, accounting for 0.09% of global GHG emissions in 2012. The sensitive analysis shows that the lifetime and energy production of wind turbine have large influences on the GHG emission intensity of both onshore and offshore wind turbines, implying that it is an effective way to prolong the lifetime of wind turbine and increase the energy production of wind turbine to reduce the GHG emission intensity of wind turbine. The sensitivity analysis further shows that the distance from wind turbine factory to wind farm site has more significant influence on the life-cycle GHG emission intensities of both onshore and offshore wind turbines than that from wind farm site to the recycling and landfill locations, suggesting that the wind farm site and the wind turbine factory should be as close as possible. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","GHG; Life-cycle assessment; Offshore wind turbine; Onshore wind turbine; Wind energy","Carbon dioxide; Electric utilities; Fixed platforms; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Life cycle; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind farms; Onshore wind farms; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Wind power; Energy productions; Environmental sustainability; Floating platforms; Investment decisions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle GHG emissions; Off-shore wind energy; Onshore wind turbine; Offshore wind turbines","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85057175664",NA,NA

With production increasing worldwide, it is timely to appraise all aspects of aquaculture when considering its expanding role as a food source. In this regard, one regularly overlooked aspect of mollusc aquaculture is waste generation: namely the production of calcareous shells. Shells from the aquaculture industry are widely regarded as a nuisance waste product, yet at the same time, calcium carbonate is mined in the form of limestone and viewed as a valuable commodity. In a time of increased awareness of the need for a circular economy, the aquaculture and seafood industry should consider shells as a valuable biomaterial that can be reused for both environmental and economic benefit. This review discusses the current waste shell issue and identifies large-scale shell applications that are already in place. Further, it highlights proposed applications that have the potential to be scaled up to address the problem of waste shell accumulations and reduce our reliance on environmentally damaging incineration and landfill disposal. Of the plethora of shell valorisation techniques proposed in the scientific literature, this review will focus only on those that can incorporate large-scale shell utilisation, and do not require high-energy processing, and are thus; simple, sustainable and potentially economically viable. Further, this review questions whether, in many cases, shells can provide more inherent value being returned to the marine environment rather than being used in land-based applications. © 2018 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd","aquaculture; biomimicry; mollusc shell; sustainability; waste valorisation","","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85040733903",NA,NA

A 5–10% yearly increase in the amount of used electrical and electronic equipment that are disposed of prudently can cause environmental hazards that have an aversive effect on human health, marine life, contamination of groundwater, and reduces soil’s fertility. Management of this enormous influx of electrical and electronic waste is a challenge for developing countries like Bangladesh with barebones solid waste management infrastructure. Inadequacy of public awareness, policies and poor budget in the field of waste management are few of the key factors behind this delineating scenario. In this study, the picture electrical and electronic waste productions in Bangladesh along with the recent E-waste management systems have been presented comprehensively. Based on the study, it was concluded that most of the adapted E-waste management methods are conversational and detached from current technological capability. A set of sustainable E-waste management system has been suggested along with the challenges, which might appear during the implementation of these strategies. Successful implementation of these suggested systems would advance the quality of E-waste management in Bangladesh increasing the current 35% overall E-waste recycling rate and offer enormous energy from the waste. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bangladesh; E-waste; E-waste management; E-waste to energy conversion","alternative energy; developing world; electronic equipment; electronic waste; public health; recycling; renewable resource; sustainable development; waste management; Bangladesh; Bangladesh; developing country; e-waste; electronics; policy; procedures; recycling; waste management; Bangladesh; Developing Countries; Electronic Waste; Electronics; Policy; Recycling; Waste Management","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85056882009",NA,NA

They produce 50% of global waste and 75% of green-house gas emissions. The UN estimates that 66% of the world's population will live in cities by 2050 while the global urban footprint will triple over the years to 2030. Thus cities, as a system of production and consumption, threaten the environmental sustainability of the globe. Looping actions-reuse, recycling and recovery of resources (materials, energy, water, land and infrastructure)-can help to address resource scarcity and wastage in cities. However, there are many challenges to implementation. Much of the literature explores the challenges to looping actions within resource sectors and for specific actions (i.e., challenges to adaptive reuse of buildings, recycling of material waste, energy recovery from sewage). It often does so without any clear reference to context. Nexus solutions are becoming a popular resource looping response to tackling wastage in cities. Some of the challenges to implementation have been explored, but influence of context has not been investigated. In this paper we explore the challenges facing the implementation of looping actions in cities. Using a mixed methods approach, we identify 58 challenges to looping actions across eight themes. We also establish the challenges to implementing a nexus solution. The research identifies five common implementation challenges. Addressing these challenges could enable looping actions across resource types in cities. The research also demonstrates how context affects the challenges to implementing looping actions and nexus solutions in cities. Nevertheless, the analysis suggests that there are some common levers for promoting looping actions and nexus solutions in cities, regardless of context. © 2019 by the authors.","Circular cities; Circular economy; Nexus: recycle; Resource looping; Resource management; Reuse and energy recovery; Urban sustainability","greenhouse gas; natural resource; recycling; resource management; resource scarcity; sewage; sustainability","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85059977479",NA,NA

New tools are required to support practitioners, decision-makers and policy-makers towards more CE practices, as well as to monitor the effects of CE adoption. Worldwide, academics, industrialists and politicians all agree on the need to use CE-related measuring instruments to manage this transition at different systemic levels. In this context, a wide range of circularity indicators (C-indicators) has been developed in recent years. Yet, as there is not one single definition of the CE concept, it is of the utmost importance to know what the available indicators measure in order to use them properly. Indeed, through a systematic literature review – considering both academic and grey literature – 55 sets of C-indicators, developed by scholars, consulting companies and governmental agencies, have been identified, encompassing different purposes, scopes, and potential usages. Inspired by existing taxonomies of eco-design tools and sustainability indicators, and in line with the CE characteristics, a classification of indicators aiming to assess, improve, monitor and communicate on the CE performance is proposed and discussed. In the developed taxonomy including 10 categories, C-indicators are differentiated regarding criteria such as the levels of CE implementation (e.g. micro, meso, macro), the CE loops (maintain, reuse, remanufacture, recycle), the performance (intrinsic, impacts), the perspective of circularity (actual, potential) they are taking into account, or their degree of transversality (generic, sector-specific). In addition, the database inventorying the 55 sets of C-indicators is linked to an Excel-based query tool to facilitate the selection of appropriate indicators according to the specific user's needs and requirements. This study enriches the literature by giving a first need-driven taxonomy of C-indicators, which is experienced on several use cases. It provides a synthesis and clarification to the emerging and must-needed research theme of C-indicators, and sheds some light on remaining key challenges like their effective uptake by industry. Eventually, limitations, improvement areas, as well as implications of the proposed taxonomy are intently addressed to guide future research on C-indicators and CE implementation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Circularity indicators; Selection tool; Taxonomy","Decision making; Environmental protection; Query processing; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Consulting companies; Eco-design tools; Governmental agency; Grey literature; Measuring instruments; Sustainability indicators; Systematic literature review; Taxonomies","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85054583331",NA,NA

With regard to the environmental sustainability of LFM, previous research has focused on life-cycle assessment and the climate impact of energy generation using refuse-derived fuel from mined landfills. These studies were commonly based on hypothetical models paying little attention to emissions resulting from operations (e.g. excavation, processing, transportation). Since LFM involves a broad range of stakeholders, the objective of the present study is to investigate LFM empirically in a regional context using data from eight mined landfills in Germany. A material flow analysis, which included a calculation of energy consumption and related emissions from operations, was carried out and factors affecting material flows were determined based on environmental scanning. LFM operations required on average 103 MJ diesel (≙2.4 kg) and 1.9 MJ electricity per tonne excavated waste, producing 12 kg of CO2 equivalent. Transportation proved to be the sub-process with the largest energy consumption by far, producing 58% of total emissions, followed by processing (27%). The average transportation distance was 122 km; however - in contrast to previous studies - transportation distances for recovered soils (84 km) and asphalt (175 km) were considerably longer. Decisive for energy consumption were: a) the option of excavating waste lifts one at a time, b) an on-site processing option, c) processability of waste, and d) an on-site reuse option and/or nearby recovery facilities for soils. Flexibility, pragmatism and coordination of stakeholders proved to be key factors due to the complex and individual character of LFM projects as well as numerous interfaces. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon foot print; Influencing factors; Landfill mining operations; Logistics of soils; Regional material flow analysis; Transportation","Coordination reactions; Energy utilization; Factor analysis; Life cycle; Materials handling; Recovery; Refuse derived fuels; Soils; Sustainable development; Transportation; Carbon foot prints; Environmental scanning; Environmental sustainability; Influencing factors; Landfill mining; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Material flow analysis; Transportation distance; Land fill","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85054465627",NA,NA

Notably there have been cases of humpback whales getting entangled in 'ghost' fishing nets, and endangered turtles ingesting plastic wastes in Watamu beach in Kenya. The aim of the current study was to assess the composition and management of plastic waste discarded by households in Watamu ward. Stratified random sampling was used to collect data from households in four sub-locations within Watamu ward. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics (the Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher's Exact test). The composition of plastics usually discarded as waste by households in order of dominance were low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, high density polyethylene and polypropylene (FH=37.959, p = 0.000). From the results, only 0.7% of respondents recycled their plastic waste. The most preferred disposal method of household plastic waste was open dumpsites (61.4%) followed by burning (12.9%) and discards (6.4%). Majority of respondents (93.6%), re-use some plastic containers for food, water, and oil storage. There was a significant difference in terms of how the respondents re-used their plastic waste in the four sub-locations (FH=36.437, p=0.005). In conclusion, the current plastic waste disposal methods at Watamu are not environmentally friendly and recycling is still at a smaller scale despite its potential to generate income and clean the environment, and promote ecosystem services and human wellbeing. © 2019 GJESM.","Plastic composition; Plastic waste; Recycling; Reuse; Waste management","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85065083130",NA,NA

It consists of a wide range of elements and compounds including both valuable and hazardous materials. E-waste can contaminate the environment and threaten human health through its improper recycling and disposal methods. Moreover, E-waste represents a significant potential source of valuable materials to make the recycling of this waste economically fascinating. This chapter presents an overview of E-waste treatment technologies including sanitary landfill and recycling of precious metals, nonmetal elements, plastics, and glasses. The recycling of E-waste has become a significant issue because of the strange growth in the production of E-waste and increased awareness among people regarding environmental protection. Consequently, the primitive treatment technologies cannot reach the future obligations of industry because of the potential risk of environmental contamination, high cost, and low efficiency. An effective utilization of the reusable resources is therefore a prerequisite for developing new technologies to treat E-waste. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Several questions can arise related to this major environmental problem and its impact on terrestrial ecosystems, mainly, whether MPs can transport contaminants (e.g. pesticides) to the soil matrix and if they can be a carrier of pesticides to soil biota. To contribute to the understanding of these issues, earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed for 14 days to soil containing two different sized MPs (5 mm and 0.25 m-1 mm) that were either previously sprayed or not with chlorpyrifos (CPF). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured to track the exposure of the earthworms to MPs, both non-sprayed and sprayed with CPF. The behaviour of the earthworms in the test containers and the movement of MPs in the soil were assessed. The concentration of CPF in soil at the end of the experiment differed between the treatments with MPs of different sizes (17.9 ng g -1 and 2442 ng g -1 for large and small MPs, respectively). Despite the ability of the MPs to release CPF to the soil, the earthworms avoided the contaminated MPs at the highest contaminant level. At a lower concentration of CPF (large MPs), the earthworms avoided the MPs, but the contact time with contaminated soil was higher, as shown by the enhanced level of TBARs and AChE inhibition. However, no evidence of MPs uptake was recorded, thus it was not demonstrated that MPs can be carriers of pesticides to earthworms. © 2019 CSIRO.","Acetylcholine; Ecotoxicology; Oxidative stress; Terrestrial ecosystems; Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances","agrochemical; concentration (composition); earthworm; ecotoxicology; ethylene; marine ecosystem; organic pollutant; oxidative stress; pesticide; plastic; pollution effect; soil biota; soil pollution; terrestrial ecosystem; Eisenia fetida","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85056113942",NA,NA

Since the origin of the anthropocene, a myriad of anthropogenic impacts have been assaulting the environmental quality of the oceans and the abundance of marine living resources. While more than 10,000 chemicals, many of which are contaminating the oceans, are traded in the world, the accelerated rate of global warming has exceeded preindustrial levels by 1°C due to cumulative CO2 emissions, causing ocean warming and acidification. Pervasive pollution by plastic (e.g., microplastics) is now chronic and widely disseminated, affecting many species in the ocean. The ecological footprint of these stressors is revealed in the interaction of ocean pollution and climate change, altering the biogeochemical processes sustaining marine ecosystems and pushing marine biodiversity to tipping points; however, the ocean is the best ecological ally for human beings to confront and mitigate these impacts. While the oceans and blue carbon ecosystems serve as sinks to capture and store CO2, natural marine bioremediation with the associated depuration system performed by marine species can help to counteract chemical pollution to restore marine and coastal ecosystems. In addition to the conventional human-made approaches to abate and mitigate anthropogenic marine pollution and climate change, this work highlights the importance of precautionary solutions in concert with the role of marine species providing ecological services and functioning as natural bioremediators to maintain the health of the oceans and conserve marine biodiversity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The descriptive data analysis reveals significant differences among EU countries in terms of the municipal waste generated and the recycling rate. The municipal waste generated registers decrease, whereas there are significant increases in terms of the recycling rates in the EU countries. The qualitative research is based on the analysis of structured interviews among stakeholders, relevant for the waste management in Romania. The information obtained based on interviews was processed using NVivo and the main findings are focused on recommendations for improving the waste management system. We have identified a lack of adequate public support in the waste field due to insufficient awareness programs, lack of operator’s obligation for separate waste sanitation, people’s discouragement to separate their household waste, and lack of bins to separate collection. The correction of identified weaknesses could lead to an improved waste management system, feasible only through an active involvement of stakeholders. © 2019 The Author(s).","Community-based initiative; Household consumption; Municipal waste management; Policy recommendations; Recycle; Stakeholders’ perception; Sustainable economy","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85076899473",NA,NA

In the present study, we report the activities of an environmental education project spanning a 3-year period in São Vicente, a city surrounded by marine habitats in the southeastern state of São Paulo. This project was part of a university initiative aiming to promote shared knowledge between marine biology student-monitors and the encircling community. With the aid of informal and practical educational activities, we introduced topics of marine zoology, marine ecology, waste management and recycling to 200 fifth-year primary students. Using pre- and post-instructional questionnaires, we evaluated the students' general knowledge of provided ocean and coastal literacy topics. Our results showed a significant difference between initial and final perception across all questions, with a higher questionnaire score after activities. The highest increase in perception concerned lessons on the marine fauna found around the school (94.6% from the initial 7.9%), pointing to the intrinsic value of teaching biological sciences from a zoological perspective. Increased knowledge retention was also observed in lessons on pollution (52.6% from 26.7%), recycling (77.2% from 61.9%), and regional waste treatment (51.8% from 24.2%). Overall, this initiative proved to be a fruitful addition to the school curriculum, especially considering the relevance of rapid urbanization, environmental degradation and water pollution in São Vicente and the role these children might exert as critical-thinking citizens in the future. On the other end, our monitors were also provided with the opportunity for an informal teaching environment complementary to their usual academic-centric degree, with a fresh perspective on accessible scientific communication. © 2019 Stefanelli-Silva, Pardo, Paixão and Costa.","Elementary students; Environmental education; Marine zoology; Recycling; University outreach","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85069773436",NA,NA

Of the 8.2 billion tonnes that are currently used, about 7 billion tonnes are produced from dedicated agricultural, grass and forest land and another 1.2 billion tonnes stem from agricultural residues. Economic and environmentally efficient pathways for production and utilization of lignocellulose for chemical products and energy are needed to expand the bioeconomy. This opinion paper arose from the research network “Lignocellulose as new resource platform for novel materials and products” funded by the German federal state of Baden-Württemberg and summarizes original research presented in this special issue. It first discusses how the supply of lignocellulosic biomass can be organized sustainably and suggests that perennial biomass crops (PBC) are likely to play an important role in future regional biomass supply to European lignocellulosic biorefineries. Dedicated PBC production has the advantage of delivering biomass with reliable quantity and quality. The tailoring of PBC quality through crop breeding and management can support the integration of lignocellulosic value chains. Two biorefinery concepts using lignocellulosic biomass are then compared and discussed: the syngas biorefinery and the lignocellulosic biorefinery. Syngas biorefineries are less sensitive to biomass qualities and are technically relatively advanced, but require high investments and large-scale facilities to be economically feasible. Lignocellulosic biorefineries require multiple processing steps to separate the recalcitrant lignin from cellulose and hemicellulose and convert the intermediates into valuable products. The refining processes for high-quality lignin and hemicellulose fractions still need to be further developed. A concept of a modular lignocellulosic biorefinery is presented that could be flexibly adapted for a range of feedstock and products by combining appropriate technologies either at the same location or in a decentralized form. © 2018 The Authors.

The sources of PAEs in agricultural soil mainly include agricultural film, chemical fertilizer, and sewage irrigation. We collected published data of PAE levels in soil-crop systems（greenhouse vegetable and open field planting systems）from the Pearl River delta, Yangtze River delta, Bohai rim, and northeast China. The concentrations of dibutyl phthalate（DBP）and di （2-ethylhexyl）phthalate（DEHP）in vegetables in the Yangtze River delta were higher than those in the Pearl Riv⁃ er delta and Bohai rim, while the concentrations of DBP and DEHP in soils in northeast China were lower than those in other regions. The daily intake of PAEs was evaluated for different age groups from different regions of China, suggesting potential health risks.

Positive Development theory holds that development could create more net ecological and social gains than no construction at all. It explains how existing conceptual, physical and institutional structures are inherently biased against the preservation and expansion of social and natural life-support systems, and proposes explicit reforms to planning, design and decision making that would enable development to increase future options and social and natural life-support systems - in absolute terms. Net-Positive Design and Sustainable Urban Development is aimed at students, academics, professionals and sustainability advocates who wonder why existing approaches have been ineffective. It explains how to reform the anti-ecological biases in our current frameworks of environmental governance, planning, decision making and design - and suggests how to make these changes. Cities can increase both the ‘public estate’ (reduce social stratification, inequity and other causes of conflict, increase environmental quality, wellbeing and access to basic needs, etc.); and the ‘ecological base’ (sequester more carbon and produce more energy than used during construction and operation, increase ecological space to support ecological carrying capacity, ecosystem functions and services, restore the bioregions and wilderness, etc.).

Our scenarios characterize changes in organic waste production, bioenergy facility build-out, bioenergy byproduct quality, and soil response. Moderate to upper bound growth in the bioenergy sector with annual byproduct disposal over 100 years could provide a cumulative GHG offset of 50-400 MMTCO2 equiv, with an additional 80-300 MMTC sequestered in soils. This corresponds to net GHG mitigation over 100 years equivalent to 340-1500 MMTCO2 equiv (80-350% of California's annual emissions).

A variety of empirical methods have been used to measure behavioral spillovers to date, from qualitative self-reports to statistical/econometric analyses, from online and lab experiments to field experiments. The aim of this paper is to critically review the main experimental and non-experimental methods to measure behavioral spillovers to date, and to discuss their methodological strengths and weaknesses. A consensus mixed-method approach is then discussed which uses between-subjects randomization and behavioral observations together with qualitative self-reports in a longitudinal design in order to follow up subjects over time. In particular, participants to an experiment are randomly assigned to a treatment group where a behavioral intervention takes place to target behavior 1, or to a control group where behavior 1 takes place absent any behavioral intervention. A behavioral spillover is empirically identified as the effect of the behavioral intervention in the treatment group on a subsequent, not targeted, behavior 2, compared to the corresponding change in behavior 2 in the control group. Unexpected spillovers and additional insights (e.g., drivers, barriers, mechanisms) are elicited through analysis of qualitative data. In the spirit of the pre-analysis plan, a systematic checklist is finally proposed to guide researchers and policy-makers through the main stages and features of the study design in order to rigorously test and identify behavioral spillovers, and to favor transparency, replicability, and meta-analysis of studies. © 2019 Galizzi and Whitmarsh.","Behavioral spillovers; Experimental design; Lab-field experiments; Mixed-methods; Spillovers","","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85065103912",NA,NA

A major effect of global change on carbon cycling is altered exposure of natural organic matter (NOM) to solar radiation, particularly solar UV radiation. In terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, NOM is degraded by UV and visible radiation, resulting in the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide, as well as a range of products that can be more easily degraded by microbes (photofacilitation). On land, droughts and land-use change can reduce plant cover causing an increase in exposure of plant litter to solar radiation. The altered transport of soil organic matter from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems also can enhance exposure of NOM to solar radiation. An increase in emission of CO2 from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to the effects of global warming, such as droughts and thawing of permafrost soils, fuels a positive feedback on global warming. This is also the case for greenhouse gases other than CO2, including methane and nitrous oxide, that are emitted from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These trace gases also have indirect or direct impacts on stratospheric ozone concentrations. The interactive effects of UV radiation and climate change greatly alter the fate of synthetic and biological contaminants. Contaminants are degraded or inactivated by direct and indirect photochemical reactions. The balance between direct and indirect photodegradation or photoinactivation of contaminants is likely to change with future changes in stratospheric ozone, and with changes in runoff of coloured dissolved organic matter due to climate and land-use changes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.","","carbon; carbon dioxide; fresh water; analysis; animal; Arctic; atmosphere; chemistry; climate change; drought; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; ice cover; natural resource; ozone depletion; ozone layer; photolysis; pollutant; sea; solar energy; ultraviolet radiation; Animals; Arctic Regions; Atmosphere; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Droughts; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Fresh Water; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Ice Cover; Natural Resources; Oceans and Seas; Ozone Depletion; Photolysis; Solar Energy; Stratospheric Ozone; Ultraviolet Rays","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85062883421",NA,NA

Besides, the regional heterogeneity of such impact is examined. The results show that: (1) ASC increases EIAP and IEIAP significantly, while ASC decreases DEIAP, which is explained by the structural effect and different planting modes of different crops; (2) the impact in the three administrative regions is similar to national situation, except the impact of ASC on DEIAP in the West Region, which is explained by regional differences of vegetable mechanization; (3) the result of the six vegetable production regions reveals greater regional heterogeneity, and this is attributed to the scale economy effect and the incremental effect of vegetable mechanization; and (4) fuel price, income, agricultural labor, old dependency ratio, and fiscal expenditure have different but significant impacts on EIAP, DEIAP, and IEIAP.

The ecological impact of MP pollution is still unknown, thus there is an urgent need for more knowledge. One key task is to identify species suitable as sentinels for monitoring in key eco-compartments, such as coastal waters. In Norway, mussels (Mytilus spp.) have been monitored for hazardous contaminants through OSPAR since 1981. Norway has the longest coastline in Europe and adding MP to the Norwegian Mussel Watch is therefore important in a European and global context. The present study reports MP data in mussels (332 specimens) collected from multiple sites (n = 15) spanning the whole Norwegian coastline. MPs were detected at all locations, except at one site on the west coast. Among the most surprising findings, mussels from the Barents Sea coastline in the Finnmark region, contained significantly more MPs than mussels from most of the southern part of the country, despite the latter sites being located much closer to major urban areas. Only mussels from a site located very close to Oslo, the capital, contained levels similar to those observed in the remote site in Finnmark. In total an average of 1.5 (±2.3) particles ind−1 and 0.97 (±2.61) particles w.w. g−1 was found. The most common MPs were &lt;1 mm in size, and fibres accounted for 83% of particles identified, although there was inter-site variability. Thirteen different polymeric groups were identified; cellulosic being the most common and black rubbery particles being the second. This study suggests Mytilus spp. are suitable for semi-quantitative and qualitatively monitoring of MPs in coastal waters. However, some uncertainties remain including mussel size as a confounding factor that may influence ingestion, the role of depuration and other fate related processes, and this call for further research. Mussels from 14 out of 15 sites along the Norwegian coast contained microplastics of a total of thirteen different polymers groups. © 2018 The Authors","Biomonitoring; Cellophane; Ecotoxicology; Mussels; Rubber","Cellophane; Landforms; Marine pollution; Molluscs; Polymers; Rubber; Urban growth; Biomonitoring; Coastal waters; Eco-toxicology; Ecological impacts; Global context; Hazardous contaminants; Mussels; Quantitative study; Pollution detection; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; paint; plastic; resin; plastic; biomonitoring; coastal water; ecotoxicology; mollusc; plastic waste; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; rubber; Article; Barents Sea; chemical analysis; coastal waters; controlled study; environmental monitoring; length; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; Mytilus; nonhuman; Norway; pollution; polymerization; qualitative research; quantitative study; sentinel species; analysis; animal; chemistry; environmental monitoring; Mytilus; particle size; pollution; procedures; water pollutant; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Finnmark; Norway; Mytilus; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Mytilus; Norway; Particle Size; Plastics; Water Pollutants","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85053479144",NA,NA

In 2016, 44.7 million tonnes of e-waste were generated in the world, which is equivalent to 6.1 kg for each person. E-waste is classified as a hazardous waste, but unlike other categories, e-waste also has significant potential for value recovery. As a result it is traded significantly between the developed and developing world, both as waste for disposal and as a resource for metal recovery. Only 20% of global e-waste in 2016 was properly recycled or disposed of, with the fate of the remaining 80% undocumented – likely to be dumped, traded or recycled under inferior conditions. This review paper provides an overview of the global e-waste resource and identifies the major challenges in the sector in terms of generation, global trade and waste management strategies. It lists the specific hazards associated with this type of waste that need to be taken into account in its management and includes a detailed overview of technologies employed or proposed for the recovery of value from e-waste. On the basis of this overview the paper identifies future directions for effective e-waste processing towards sustainable waste/resource management. It becomes clear that there is a strong divide between developed and developing countries with regard to this sector. While value recovery is practiced in centralised facilities employing advanced technologies in a highly regulated industrial environment in the developed world, in the developing world such recovery is practiced in a largely unregulated artisanal industry employing simplistic, labour intensive and environmentally hazardous approaches. Thus value is generated safely in the hi-tech environment of the developed world, whereas environmental burdens associated with exported waste and residual waste from simplistic processing remain largely in developing countries. It is argued that given the breadth of available technologies, a more systematic evaluation of the entire e-waste value chain needs to be conducted with a view to establishing integrated management of this resource (in terms of well-regulated value recovery and final residue disposal) at the appropriately local rather than global scale. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","E-waste recycling; Environmental pollution; Hydrometallurgy; Pyrometallurgy; Trans-boundary movement of e-waste; Waste management","Commerce; Developing countries; Hazards; Hydrometallurgy; Metal recovery; Oscillators (electronic); Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Pyrometallurgy; Recycling; Waste disposal; Waste management; Wastes; E-waste recycling; Electrical and electronic equipment; Environmental burdens; Environmental pollutions; Industrial environments; Integrated management; Trans-boundary; Waste management strategies; Electronic Waste; developing world; electronic waste; hazard assessment; recycling; regulatory framework; trade flow; transboundary pollution; waste management; waste technology; adult; developing country; electronic waste; hazardous waste; human; metal recovery; resource management; review; e-waste; recycling; waste management; Developing Countries; Electronic Waste; Hazardous Waste; Recycling; Waste Management","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85055580206",NA,NA

Improving saline-sodic soils with FGDG is one of the effective ways to utilize FGDG. However, the use of FGDG has severe impacts on the environment. With growing application of FGDG for improving soils, there is an increasing necessity to analyze the environmental impact on the entire agricultural application process. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is useful for comparing the potential risks of different environmental impact categories and stages. Traditional LCA methods have some limits in comparing various schemes, while the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) has its unique advantages in multi-objective decision-making. Therefore, this study identified and compared the environmental impacts of four alternative schemes in three stages using LCA combined with TOPSIS. In this study, the environmental impact of improving 1 ha saline-sodic soil was assessed, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze the effects of the changes in heavy metals in FGDG and in irrigation. The highest impact category was water consumption, with a weighted environmental impact value of 2.20 × 10−1 and a contribution rate of 42.216%. The second-highest environmental impact category was soil toxicity, with a weighted environmental impact potential value of 8.04 × 10−2 and a contribution rate of 15.429%. The soil toxicity was mostly from the application stage, while the water and energy consumption were mainly from the irrigation of planting stage. Acidification and eutrophication were mainly from fertilizer applications. Effective measures, including scientific use of fertilizers and pesticide, reasonable irrigation and strict control of heavy metals in FGDG should be employed to mitigate environmental risks during the agricultural application of FGDG. This study constructed a framework for the environmental impacts of improving saline-sodic soils with FGDG integrated with TOPSIS, and can be considered as an effort to advance the application of LCA. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental impact assessment; Flue gas desulfurization gypsum; Life cycle assessment; Saline-sodic soil; Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS)","Coal combustion; Decision making; Desulfurization; Energy utilization; Environmental impact assessments; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Flue gases; Flues; Gas plants; Gypsum; Gypsum plants; Heavy metals; Irrigation; Metal analysis; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Toxicity; Environmental risks; Fertilizer applications; Flue gas desulfurization gypsums; Ideal solutions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multi objective decision making; Power generation plants; Saline-sodic soils; Life cycle","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85053186229",NA,NA

Among the strategies to attain this goal have been the attempts to recover energy from municipal solid waste (MSW). About 60% of MSW is carbonaceous, consisting of materials which can either be biodegraded into fuels like methane or incinerated, thereby generating utilizable energy. MSW also contains several components-like metallic scrap and glass pieces-which can be reused or recycled, thereby achieving energy conservation. Given these attributes, MSW appears to be a potential source of energy and resources. Indeed, this belief that MSW is usable if only we try sincerely enough to do so prompts most of us to keep generating much more MSW than is warranted. But how realizable really is the energy potential of MSW? What perils loom into view when we actually set out to utilize MSW as an energy source? The present study addresses these crucially important questions. Methods: The work is based on a critical content analysis of the prior art. Results: The generation of MSW has consistently outpaced the world's efforts to dispose of it cleanly, and the energy (and material) recovery from MSW is easier said than done. In most instances, what is technically feasible is economically unfeasible. And what is economically feasible-such as setting the waste on fire as is often done in developing countries-is exceedingly harmful to the environment and the human health. Measures such as sanitary landfilling and incineration create as many new problems as the old ones they solve. Moreover, despite the use of these less-than-adequate technologies, a major portion of MSW generated in the world lies untreated. Conclusions: As the MSW output is expected to double by 2025, this situation is only set to become worse. Rising tides of E-waste would compound the problem even further. Hence, enormous stress should be put on the reduction of MSW generation by controlling wanton consumerism and wastage, rather than continuing with it in the false hope that technology will soon provide a magical solution and eliminate the problem. © 2018 The Author(s).","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Composting; Incineration; Landfills; Municipal solid waste","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Composting; Developing countries; Electronic Waste; Incineration; Land fill; Scrap metal reprocessing; Waste incineration; Content analysis; Energy recovery; Energy source; Glass pieces; Human health; Landfilling; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Potential sources; Municipal solid waste; anaerobic digestion; biodegradation; biogas; composting; electronic waste; energy conservation; glass; incineration; landfill; methane; municipal solid waste; recycling; sustainable development; waste management","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85056710157",NA,NA

In this study, comprehensive assessment methodologies for soil risk in industrial areas were developed. The comprehensive assessment covered ecological and human health risks of soil pollution, as well as vulnerability of different types of risk receptors. Comprehensive ecological risk assessment integrated potential ecological risk assessment and landscape vulnerability assessment. Comprehensive social risk assessment specialized human health risk assessment by introducing spatial distribution of population. A typical industrial area in China was studied, and the quantitative and spatial assessments of the comprehensive soil risk were presented. The results showed that the spatial distribution of soil comprehensive ecological and social risks differed. High-risk areas of soil comprehensive ecological risk in the study area were mainly farmlands and nature reserves. Inhabited areas and industrial zones were less affected by comprehensive ecological risk of soil. By contrast, the spatial distribution of soil comprehensive social risk and human activities showed a clear trend of convergence.

In California estuaries, O. lurida is adapted to local salinity regimes and populations differ in low salinity tolerance. In this study, oysters from three California populations were reared for two generations in a laboratory common garden and subsequently exposed to low salinity seawater. Comparative transcriptomics was then used to understand species-level responses to hyposmotic stress and population-level mechanisms underlying divergent salinity tolerances. Gene expression patterns indicate Olympia oysters are sensitive to hyposmotic stress: All populations respond to low salinity by up-regulating transcripts indicative of protein unfolding, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest after sub-lethal exposure. Among O. lurida populations, transcriptomic profiles differed constitutively and in response to low salinity. Despite two generations in common-garden conditions, transcripts encoding apoptosis modulators were constitutively expressed at significantly different levels in the most tolerant population. Expression of cell death regulators may facilitate cell fate decisions when salinity declines. Following low salinity exposure, oysters from the more tolerant population expressed a small number of mRNAs at significantly higher levels than less tolerant populations. Proteins encoded by these transcripts regulate ciliary activity within the mantle cavity and may function to prolong valve closure and reduce mortality in low salinity seawater. Collectively, gene expression patterns suggest sub-lethal impacts of hyposmotic stress in Olympia oysters are considerable and that even oysters with greater low salinity tolerance may be vulnerable to future freshwater flooding events. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; local adaptation; oyster; RNA-seq; salinity; transcriptome","transcriptome; adaptation; animal; California; estuary; genetics; Ostrea; population genetics; salinity; salt tolerance; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; California; Estuaries; Genetics, Population; Ostrea; Salinity; Salt Tolerance; Transcriptome","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85054482747",NA,NA

The drainage/storage layers tested were a plastic preformed layer and a mineral layer (expanded perlite). The substrates tested were a volcanic medium and a recycled crushed bricks medium. Three types of vegetation were tested: a sedum mix (S. acre, S. album, S. reflexum, S. sexangolare), an herbaceous perennial mix (Bromus erectus, Melica ciliata, Campanula spicata, Potentilla pusilla, Euphorbia cyparissias), and a suffruticose mix (Dianthus spp., Thymus serpillum, Clinopodium nepeta, Artemisia alba, Anthemis tinctoria). In addition, as a control, gravel was considered to mimic a conventional roof with storage layer. The experiment was set in May 2014. The runoff volumes were evaluated by weighing, after each rainstorm, the water collected in tanks placed under the trays. Plant closure was evaluated elaborating digital image analysis taken on monthly basis. The results related to the preliminary phase from July 2014 to June 2015 indicate seasonal effects on the hydrological performance of green roof components; in fact, probably because of the low losses by evapotranspiration, the reduction of rainfall runoff in fall and winter was quite low (on average, about 31.5%), with little differences among the different microcosm configurations. Considering the entire period, the best performance in terms of water retention in our climate context was shown by the green roof configuration composed by suffruticose mix, recycled crushed bricks substrate and expanded perlite drainage/storage layer, which allowed a reduction of 62.7% of the total rainfall runoff compared to 14.1% of the conventional roof with gravel. Canopy closure of suffruticose and herbaceous mixes were higher than that of sedum mix throughout the experiment, and values were increased by crushed bricks medium and perlite drainage/storage layer. © ISHS.","Canopy closure; Green infrastructures; Stormwater runoff","","Conference Paper","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85056896420",NA,NA

An efficient post-harvest system ensures that the harvested product reaches the customer in the shortest possible time interval without compromising the volume, quality, and safety of the product. The objective of this paper is to identify and model the critical causal factors of post-harvest losses (PHL) in the fruit and vegetable (F&V) supply chain in India, with the help of a detailed literature review and expert opinions. Fifteen causal factors were identified using the decision making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method, which is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tool. This was applied for determining the cause-effect relationships among the identified factors. The results highlighted that the most critical factors that should be tackled to ensure progressive PHL reduction are: lack of proper packaging facilities (PHL3), lack of proper storage facilities (PHL1), insufficient infrastructure (PHL4), improved handling of the products at the farm and marketplace (PHL2), lack of processing facilities (PHL5), lack of linkage between the farmers and processing units (PHL6), lack of linkages in the marketing channel (PHL9), and large number of intermediaries (PHL15).

These issues can be jointly addressed by an integrated and sustainable management of the soil resource carried out in the framework of two recent paradigms: circular economy and phytomanagement. Within the fields of resource conservation and regenerative (urban) land management, at least the three following fundamental aspects can be contemplated: (i) the valorization and safe recovery of organic wastes (e.g., composts, green and animal manures, and biosolids) as soil amendments (from residue to resource); (ii) the re-development and revegetation of degraded soils characterized by low organic matter content, deficient physical structure and depressed biological status (from bare to vegetated soil); and, finally, (iii) the promotion of soil health in order to support soil ecological processes, functions and concomitant ecosystem services (integration of ecocentric and anthropocentric perspectives). Here, we discuss the benefits (knowns), potential risks (known unknowns) and future/affordable uncertainties (unknowns) resulting from the application of organic amendments (OAs) to soil. Traditionally, most studies have used physical-chemical parameters to assess soil health/quality, whereas less attention has been paid to soil biological criteria. Thus, we highlight the relevance of soil biological properties as key drivers of ecological restoration and suitable indicators of soil health. Notwithstanding, special attention should be paid to “amendments-plants-microorganisms” interactions in different soils and field conditions. Finally, the risk of introduction of emerging contaminants, including for instance microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), through the application of OAs to soil, is currently a matter of much concern that must urgently be addressed if we are to continue with such practice. © Copyright © 2018 Gómez-Sagasti, Hernández, Artetxe, Garbisu and Becerril.","antibiotic-resistance genes; circular economy; contamination; degraded soils; microplastics; soil health; soil quality","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85072205682",NA,NA

The impacts of these factors on urban streams is poorly understood. We compared decay rates and invertebrate colonizers of 5 litter pack types in 4 urban streams in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada: Native Red alder (Alnus rubra) and Sitka willow (Salix sitchensis), invasive English ivy (Hedera sp.), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus) and plastic trash (i.e. Styrofoam (polystyrene (PS)), plastic bag (high-density polyethylene (HDPE)), and Mylar (polyethylene terephthalate (PET). We tested 4 hypotheses: 1) exotic ivy and blackberry leaves would decay more slowly than native leaves; 2) exotic ivy and blackberry leaves would attract fewer and less diverse stream invertebrates than native leaves; 3) plastic trash would decay more slowly than leaves; and, 4) plastic trash would attract fewer and less diverse stream invertebrates than leaves. We found no difference between the leaf litter decay rates, however plastic trash decayed more slowly than leaves. Trash decay rates were faster than reported in marine environments, suggesting that plastic trash removal should be a management priority. Stream invertebrates colonized all pack types equally. We observed significant differences in litter decay rates and invertebrate assemblage alpha and Shannon–Wiener diversities across the 4 streams - likely related to differences in stream-specific environmental attributes including flashiness, stream discharge, and biological decay. We conclude that site-specific decay forces supersede litter quality in Pacific Coast urban streams. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Exotic species; Leaf litter; Leaf traits; Macroinvertebrates; Plastic; Restoration","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85048548748",NA,NA

The total environmental impacts were calculated for seven organic peri-urban orchards identified as PUO1 to PUO7. PUO1, PUO4 and PUO6 presented the highest environmental impacts due to a higher consumption of (1) fuel, (2) plastics and (3) electricity in comparison to the other orchards. Approximately 70% of the overall impacts were indirect impacts generated in the supply chain. A more in-depth study of climate change impacts in the supply chain of the organic peri-urban orchard network revealed that the major hotspots were the sectors “extraction of crude petroleum” (29%) and “production of electricity by gas and coal” (31%) located in Spain, China and Middle East countries.

It is therefore important to understand the context-specific model-oriented applications of OR techniques in the sustainable food supply chain (SFSC) domain. While existing food supply chain reviews provide an excellent basis for this process, the explicit consideration of sustainability from a model-oriented perspective along with a structured outline of relevant SFSC research techniques are missing in extant literature. We attempt to fill this gap by reviewing 83 related scientific journal publications that utilise mathematical modelling techniques to address issues in SFSC. To this end, we first identify the salient dimensions that include economic, environmental and social issues in SFSC. We then review the models and methods that use these dimensions to solve issues that arise in SFSC. We identify some of the main challenges in analytical modelling of SFSC as well as future research directions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","food industry; models; operations research; review; sustainable supply chain","Food supply; Models; Operations research; Reviews; Supply chains; Environmental and social sustainability; Food industries; Future research directions; Scientific journals; Social issues; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85041291673",NA,NA

In this study, we aim to provide more detailed knowledge about the size and characteristics of the potential value to be captured from the resources embedded in waste. In order to investigate circular economy potentials in a real-life context, we apply case study research. The case is a municipal waste management company collecting and managing household waste. A number of initiatives are employed to collect as much waste for reuse and recycling as possible. The waste fractions with the highest collection potential are identified as being cardboard, plastics, waste wood and items for reuse. The subsequent processes of preparing these waste types for reuse and recycling are analyzed in the perspective of circular economy value creation. The data include waste amounts, the company's economic accounting, interviews and observations. From the perspective of the municipal waste authority, the largest value creation potential (economically, socially and environmentally) lies in preparing waste for reuse. Secondly, cardboard for recycling has an economic value potential. The collection, preparation and sales of waste wood and plastics constitute an economic deficit and hold limited environmental and social value. The findings suggest that the current regulation of the waste sector does not sufficiently support a transition to circular economy. From a focus on cost-effectiveness, waste managers must additionally change their mindsets towards a focus on value creation and increase reuse related activities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Sustainability; Value creation; Waste; Waste management","Cost effectiveness; Elastomers; Plastic recycling; Sustainable development; Wastes; Case study research; Circular economy; Current regulations; Potential values; Real-life contexts; Resource efficiencies; Reuse and recycling; Value creation; Waste management; municipal solid waste; recycling; sustainability; waste management; Article; case study; circular economy; Denmark; economics; empirical research; environmental sustainability; industry; recycling; waste; Collection; Cost Effectiveness; Elastomers; Preparation; Recycling; Reuse; Waste Management; Wastes; Denmark","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85046711184",NA,NA

An econometric model describing the influence of the linear economy on the environment is presented. The environment is characterized by seven key processes: change in global temperature; emissions of greenhouse gases from industry to the environment; emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture to the environment; CO2 emissions into the environment; depletion of fresh water supplies; reduction of forest cover; and economic damage from climatological disasters. The model describing the impact of the traditional linear economy on the environment consists of seven interdependent econometric equations, each comprising an autoregressive distributed lag (ADL)-model. The proposed econometric model is used to analyze the environmental effects of the present linear economy. Methodological provisions for a transformational transition of the traditional linear economic model to the closed-loop systems, which also permit the impact of the closed-loop systems on the environment to be analyzed, are set out. Seven ecological indicators are proposed as criteria for comparing the traditional linear economy and the closed-loop systems. The manuscript presents a new approach for the determination of ecological criteria for comparing linear and circular economies. The results of the study could be interesting to address circular processes, which can be used as a criterion to establish ecological management according to the status of natural resources. © 2020 by the authors.","ADL-model; Circular economy; Environment; Influence of the linear economy on the environment; Linear economy","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85065968542",NA,NA

Government plays an essential role in the diffusion of improved technologies. Cost-effectiveness analysis can provide the cost and abatement potentials of each alternative under a single abatement strategy; however, it is difficult for policy-makers to make an integrated assessment when multiple objectives are involved. This paper evaluates the performance of three distributed alternatives and two centralized alternatives for residential biomass use in rural China, including centralized biogas and centralized gasifier systems. An integrated assessment approach is built, which combines cost-benefit analysis, an entropy-weighting method, and a preference-ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations using the PROMETHEE approach. A total of 686 sample households in three regions of China were surveyed in this study. The centralized gasifier system and distributed household biogas were the top two alternatives for further development to meet the government's 2020 development goal for biogas technology. The overall biomass utilization amount in the prioritized scenario is about three times that of the business-as-usual scenario by 2020.

Plastic waste is one of the most critical environmental issues. Therefore, we investigated how WRS can deter students from using disposable plastic bottles. We conducted a survey at a Japanese university to address (1) students'Willingness To Pay (WTP) to install WRS, (2) their Willingness To Use (WTU) WRSs while acknowledging its environmental benefits, and (3) the impact of communicating information about points (1) and (2). We utilized Goal-Framing Theory (GFT) and the Integrated Framework for Encouraging Pro-Environmental Behavior (IFEP) as the theoretical background of our study. The results of our survey found that the mean WTP was 2211 JPY (1 JPY = 0.01 USD), an amount students would donate just once. This finding indicates students would be willing to pay to install a WRS at their university. The mean WTP students supported would be enough to cover the WRS installation and maintenance costs. According to our study, 58.82% of students stated that they would be willing to use WRS. In doing so, students would save 45,191 disposable plastic bottles and reduce 10,846 kg of related CO2 emissions every year. Our study also showed a statistically significant increase in WTP and WTU WRS as we introduced more and more information about pro-environmental behaviors to students. This finding indicates the importance of information campaigning and learning how to encourage pro-environmental behavior. © 2018 by the authors.","Campus sustainability; Contingent valuation method; Water bottle refill stations; Willingness to pay; Willingness to use","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental issue; integrated approach; perception; plastic; sustainability; theoretical study; willingness to pay; Japan","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85052913443",NA,NA

The rebound effect has played a role in economic growth and industrialization, yet it remains a problem for the task of reducing negative environmental impacts. This paper proposes that the size of the rebound effect, and the type of impacts it causes, may be affected by future changes in the system within which it arises. Four types of rebound effect are considered: economy-wide effects, transformational effects, frontier effects, and international rebound effects. A conceptual model of the historical role of the rebound effect in socio-technical systems, and the relationship of socio-technical systems with natural capital and human-created capital, provides a ""sandbox"" for testing ideas about the future. The model theory draws upon the concepts of natural capital, the Global Ecological Footprint, and the Great Acceleration. How the size of four types of the rebound effect might change in future, as supplies of resources from natural capital become more constrained, is discussed within three storylines. In the first storyline, natural capital declines but remains fairly stable; rebound is much decreased as resources are less available and efficiency is used up more in stabilizing supplies of goods and services. In the second storyline, growth continues without constraint amid regional rivalry; eventually there is a strong downturn in availability of resources and negative impacts on both society and natural capital. In the third storyline, impact caps are implemented for different types of resources; for some time, industry and society adapt by investing in low resource-use innovation and global cooperation on management of natural capital; once natural capital recovers and stabilizes, growth and consumption may increase along with the rebound effect, but staying within a Global Ecological Footprint of 1 Earth. The theory and model in this paper are intended to contribute to new thinking on the subject of the rebound effect. © 2018 Freeman.","Global Ecological Footprint; Natural capital; Socio-technical systems; System dynamics; The rebound effect","Environmental impact; Industrial economics; Natural resources management; Ecological footprint; Natural capital; Rebound effect; Sociotechnical systems; System Dynamics; Economic analysis","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85052849073",NA,NA

To be engaged in genetic resource preservation, farmers must find it rewarding. Besides public policies, the generation of benefits depends crucially on the revenues farmers can collect through product sales, which, in turn, depends on consumers’ preferences. If consumers are willing to pay a price premium that rewards farmers for the lower productivity and greater variability usually associated with traditional varieties, market can make a significant contribution to agrobiodiversity preservation. However, knowledge about consumer’s willingness to pay (WTP) for traditional varieties is scarce and the main research on this topic focuses on particular varieties making it difficult to generalize the results. This study, rather than determining consumers’ WTP for a specific variety, seeks to estimate the WTP for the attribute “traditional variety” itself, using a hedonic price model.

Unlike existing studies on WPB management, which focus mainly on emissions, this case study uses a resource-oriented approach to thoroughly analyze the performance of a WPB collection and recycling scheme. This study focused on the WPB take-back and recycling system managed by Bebat in Belgium. Life cycle assessment was conducted using three different existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods representing three different perspectives: Cumulative Exergy Extracted from the Natural Environment; Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP), split into impact categories called ADPelements and ADPfossilfuels; and damage to Resource Cost. A new LCIA method, the criticality-based impact assessment method, has also been introduced to cover the socioeconomic aspects of natural resource consumption. The performance of the mixed waste (i.e., batteries, flashlights) collection and sorting system was assessed from 2011 to 2013. This analysis showed that in 2012, the use of collection receptacles made of plastic bags with 30% recycled content, instead of non-recycled paper or cardboard with 30% recycled content, was one of the main reasons for the low impact of the whole system from all assessment perspectives. The performance of entire take-back and recycling system for alkaline and zinc-carbon (ZnC) batteries, the two most popular portable batteries, was subsequently analyzed and benchmarked against two incineration scenarios: with and without bottom ash recovery. The comparisons of the four LCIA methods show differing results. The most prominent result is that the ADPelements score of the recycling scenario is 7-9 times lower than that of the incineration scenario, mainly due to metals (i.e., iron and zinc) savings via recycling. The recycling system requires 17-52% less material criticality, but extracts 13-18% more exergy from the natural environment and has a higher ADPfossilfuels score (about 14-16%) than the incineration system. These comparisons indicate that although the alkaline/ZnC battery management system run by Bebat does not reduce consumption of all resources, especially fossil fuels and land, it is beneficial in terms of minerals and metals savings. To further improve the efficiency and environmental performance of the collection system, different measures were implemented. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impacts of those measures on the mixed waste collection and sorting system and the alkaline/ZnC battery take-back and recycling system. The results suggested that a combination of different measures, especially reducing the number of receptacles used and enhancing their environmental performance, can considerably reduce the resource footprint. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alkaline/ZnC batteries; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Recycling; Resource saving; Take-back system; Waste portable batteries","Ash handling; Battery management systems; Criticality (nuclear fission); Damage detection; Economics; Electric batteries; Environmental management; Exergy; Fossil fuels; Life cycle; Metal analysis; Plastic containers; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Waste incineration; Zinc; Zinc compounds; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Resource consumption; Resource savings; Socioeconomic aspects; Sustainable management; Take backs; Electronic Waste; fossil fuel; iron; metal; mineral; plastic; zinc; carbon; life cycle analysis; natural resource; recycling; waste management; zinc; alkaline battery; Article; Belgium; bottom ash; controlled study; energy conservation; incineration; life cycle assessment; recycling; sensitivity analysis; zinc carbon battery; Batteries; Carbon; Combustion; Economics; Fossil Fuels; Life Cycle; Belgium","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85029425696",NA,NA

The aim was to assess the effects of various N sources and methods of distribution on crop growth and yield, as well as on the potential risks of nitrate leaching. Processing tomato was fertilized by using (i) green manuring with several cover crops (vetch and barley alone and in several mixtures), (ii) broadcast organic fertilizers (poultry manure and by-product of leather factory), (iii) fertigation with organic fertilizer (by-product of leather factory) and (iv) fertigation with a mineral N fertilizer. N accumulation and C/N ratio were measured in the cover crops at killing date. Tomato growth and N accumulation were determined fortnightly. The concentration of NO3-N in the soil solution was measured by a suction lysimeter at 0.9 m N supply from pure barley or from mixtures with high proportion of barley (i.e. 50% or higher) were inadequate for tomato growth. Pure vetch ensured an optimal N status to the succeeding crop, but led to nitrate leaching. The mixture vetch 75%+ barley 25% ensured an adequate amount of N for tomato, while reducing the NO3-N concentration in soil solution. Poultry manure and by-product of leather factory at low N rate (i.e. 100 kg N ha−1) were both inadequate to fulfil tomato requirements. At the same N rate, fertigation with the organic fertilizers gave the same good efficacy of fertigation with the mineral fertilizer, ensuring higher environmental sustainability. The integrated use of fall-winter cover crops and fertigation could represent a sound strategy for conservative horticulture. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cover crops; Critical N; Fertigation; Mediterranean environment; Organic fertilizer","agricultural management; barley; cover crop; crop yield; experimental study; fertilizer application; food processing; growth; herb; leaching; Mediterranean environment; nitrogen; strategic approach; sustainability; Italy; Hordeum; Lycopersicon esculentum; Vicia","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85047625944",NA,NA

Plant fibres can be derived from a multitude of natural agro-sources, with the preferred choice as a composite reinforcement often being driven by abundance, geographical location, and historical use. While from a product designer's or engineer's point of view, all plant cell walls are 'similar', they have indeed substantial morphological and mechanical diversity linked to their structure, biochemical composition and the plant growing conditions. Here, we provide a holistic overview of the main types of plant cell walls used as polymer reinforcements. The relationship between their structures and properties, in constant link with potential associated composite, is specifically discussed. Then, the fibre extraction and cultivation modes are compared, through an environmental assessment. We also show how a scientist's point of view on cell wall structure and associated experimental approach lead to distinct results; following a critical review, we make recommendations on appropriate characterisation. A final discussion highlights the pertinent parameters that accurately define a composite reinforcement fibre. The review will serve as a handbook reference for researchers and designers in the field of biomaterials for appropriate selection of plant cell walls for specific composite applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Characterisation; Composite; Mechanical properties; Natural fibre; Plant cell wall; Structure","Cells; Composite materials; Cultivation; Cytology; Mechanical properties; Natural fibers; Plant cell culture; Plants (botany); Reinforcement; Structure (composition); Textile fibers; Biochemical composition; Characterisation; Composite reinforcement; Environmental assessment; Experimental approaches; Plant cell wall; Structures and properties; Technological development; Biomechanics","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85047730437",NA,NA

In this study, artificial Sophora japonica Linn. Woodland in the Beijing plain, where the million mu (66,700 ha) afforestation project was carried out, was taken as an experimental area to investigate the influences of urban green waste composting on soil improvement and soil microorganisms. Application amounts of green waste composts for each tree were as follows: CK treatment: no application of fertilizer; T1 treatment: 5 kg/each tree; T2 treatment: 10 kg/each tree; T3 treatment: 15 kg/each tree. Results showed that the application of green waste had a significant effect on soil improvement, such as improving of organic matter, available phosphorus, and available potassium content (p &lt; 0.05). The high-level application amount (T3 treatment) had a greater effect on soil improvement. Compared with the control treatment (CK), soil pH in T3 treatment decreased to 7.28-7.45, Soil organic matter contents reached more than 35 g·kg-1, and soil total nitrogen, soil available phosphorus, and soil available potassium increased by 25-28%, 200-400%, and 80-177%, respectively. Soil carbon-nitrogen ratio has increasing to 15.61-24.38 in the three treatments, which would not obviously slow down the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms in the soil. After the application of green waste compost, the soil microbial structure was changed. From the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level, bacterial abundance increased by 12-13%, but the change in bacterial diversity was not significant. The influences of pH and contents of organic matter content, available phosphorus, and rapidly available potassium on the bacterial community were greater.

SDG 6 expands the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focus on drinking water and basic sanitation to now cover the entire water cycle, including the management of water, wastewater and ecosystem resources. A UN report in 2017 states that likely over 80% of the wastewater worldwide is still discharged without adequate treatment. In several countries the wastewater management is nowadays a norm, but still there are open discussions about the kind of approach to be adopted, i.e. centralisation vs. decentralisation. The choice of the adopted technologies is strictly linked to environmental performances and economical aspects; one of the possible causes for the still enormous amount of untreated wastewater discharged into the environment can be the low “willingness to pay” for this kind of service and therefore a great focus should be given to all the technologies that are able to lower the treatment costs still maintaining reliable and robust performances in the long term. When considering wastewater as a carrier of valuable primary chemicals that can be easily converted to marketable products (fertilisers, bio-plastics, soil conditioners, biofuels, etc.), and as well as a relevant source of “new water” to be used for specific purposes, wastewater and runoff management can be highlighted as one of the most exciting challenges and occasions for a sustainable development in the near future. The paper aims to clarify the future role of CWs in circular economy, resource-oriented, and ecosystem services approaches, which want to respond to sanitation worldwide and the future research needs. We give an overview on how the conventional wastewater treatment scheme (what we call “waste paradigm”) should move towards more sustainable water and biogeochemical cycles following the new resource-oriented, circular economy and ecosystem service views. On this basis, we review the potential application of CWs within this new, and needed, paradigm. Finally, a meta-analysis shows that the scientific community involved in CWs should put more effort in making CWs more suitable for these new tasks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Constructed wetlands; Resource oriented sanitation; Treatment wetlands","biofuel; drinking water; fertilizer; plastic; biogeochemical cycle; constructed wetland; decentralization; drinking water; ecosystem service; Millenium Development Goal; sanitation; sustainable development; wastewater treatment; willingness to pay; Article; biogeochemical cycle; constructed wetland; economic aspect; ecosystem; runoff; sanitation; soil; sustainable development; technology; waste water; waste water management; water cycle; water treatment; ecosystem; environmental protection; meta analysis; sanitation; waste water; wetland; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Sanitation; Waste Water; Wetlands","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85044512177",NA,NA

Plastic particle loading in agroecosystems could be high due to inputs of some recycled organic waste and plastic film mulching, so it is vital that we develop a greater understanding of any potentially harmful or adverse impacts of these pollutants to agroecosystems. In this article, we discuss the sources of plastic particles in agroecosystems, the mechanisms, constraints and dynamic behaviour of plastic during aging on land, and explore the responses of soil organisms and plants at different levels of biological organisation to plastic particles of micro and nano-scale. Based on limited evidence at this point and understanding that the lack of evidence of ecological impact from microplastic and nanoplastic in agroecosystems does not equate to the evidence of absence, we propose considerations for addressing the gaps in knowledge so that we can adequately safeguard world food supply. © 2018","Ecotoxicology; Plant response; Plastic degradation; Soil food web; Soils","Food supply; Nanotechnology; Pollution; Soils; Eco-toxicology; Ecological impacts; Emerging pollutants; Plant response; Plastic degradation; Plastic film mulching; Soil food web; Terrestrial environments; Ecosystems; agricultural ecosystem; degradation; ecotoxicology; food web; plant; plastic waste; pollutant source; soil pollution; agroecosystem; environmental impact; food web; microplastic pollution; nanoplastic pollution; nonhuman; particle size; plant damage; plant growth; pollution; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; soil analysis; soil chemistry; soil microflora; soil pollution; soil quality; agriculture; analysis; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; soil pollutant; plastic; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Plastics; Soil Pollutants","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85041550682",NA,NA

Vegetable cropping systems are high-input and generally require large quantities of fertilization, frequent irrigation, and repeated tillage operations. Consequently, an increase in global vegetable production may have seriously negative impacts on soil health and ecosystem services. Yet, not only maintaining but improving soil health is critical to enhancing the sustainability of food production systems. Previous agricultural research mainly focused on field crop systems and largely ignored vegetable cropping systems; consequently, this represents a conspicuous research gap, one that must be addressed in order to make progress toward sustainable food production. Here, we review the literature to gain a better understanding of how management has influenced various soil health indices (soil biology, chemistry, and physical dynamics) and to evaluate the implications for soil ecosystem services in vegetable cropping systems. We found that alternative modifications to conventional vegetable production systems, which resemble methods used in organic or conservation agriculture, tended to improve aspects of soil health. For example, soil amendments generally improved soil chemical and nutrient indices of health-soil carbon levels and nitrogen reserves in particular. Incorporation of cover crops to vegetable crop rotations tended to improve nitrogen recycling via reduced nitrate leaching risks, increased soil carbon levels, and weed suppression. Reduced tillage systems were rare, presenting an important challenge and opportunity for further improving soil health dynamics in vegetable production. Notably, adopting alternative practices generally had no effect on crop yields, which implies little risk of yield penalties when agronomic management is carefully planned. Our results indicate that future sustainable vegetable cropping systems may embody a blend between organic and conventional ideologies to better maintain or improve soil ecosystem functioning. © 2018 Norris and Congreves.","Carbon sequestration; Cover crops; Organic agriculture; Organic amendments; Reduced tillage; Soil health; Soil nutrients; Vegetable production","","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85048829066",NA,NA

Nowadays, the ‘zero waste’ concept is becoming more topical through the reduction of disposed waste. Recovery of metals, nutrients and other materials that can be returned to the material cycles still remain as a challenge for future. Landfill mining (LFM) is one of the approaches that can deal with former dumpsites, and derived materials may become important for circular economy within the concept ‘beyond the zero waste’. Perspectives of material recovery can include recycling of critical industrial metals, including rare earth elements (REEs). The LFM projects performed in the Baltic Region along with a conventional source separation of iron-scrap, plastics etc. have shown that the potential of fine-grained fractions (including clay and colloidal matter) of excavated waste have considerably large amounts of potentially valuable metals and distinct REEs. In this paper analytical screening studies are discussed extending the understanding of element content in fine fraction of waste derived from excavated, separated and screened waste in a perspective of circular economy. Technological feasibility was evaluated by using modified sequential extraction technique where easy extractable amount of metals can be estimated. Results revealed that considerable concentrations of Mn (418–823 mg/kg), Ni (41–84 mg/kg), Co (10.7–19.3 mg/kg) and Cd (1.0–3.0 mg/kg) were detected in fine fraction (<10 mm) of waste sampled from Högbytorp landfill, while Cr (49–518 mg/kg) and Pb (30–264 mg/kg) were found in fine fraction (<10 mm) of waste from Torma landfill revealing wide heterogeneity of tested samples. Waste should become a utilizable resource closing the loop of anthropogenic material cycle as the hidden potential of valuable materials in dumps is considerable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Element recovery; Landfill mining; Waste valorisation; Zero waste concept","Iron scrap; Land fill; Materials handling; Rare earth elements; Rare earths; Scrap metal reprocessing; Source separation; Circular economy; Finegrained fractions; Landfill mining; Rare earth elements (REEs); Sequential extraction technique; Technological feasibility; Valorisation; Zero waste; Extraction","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85046016140",NA,NA

Soil's components and ecological functions have been dramatically affected by rapid urbanization in recent decades. This is especially true for peri-urban ecosystems. A peri-urban ecosystem comprises the interaction and transition zones between urban and rural or natural ecosystems. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems are identified with both urban and rural/natural ecosystems' structural and functional features, and are prone to being affected by urbanization pressures. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems provide essential life-support functions and ecosystem services for urban and rural residents, including food supply, water purification, water conservation, contamination interception, leisure and entertainment services, cultural services, and more. Under rapid urbanization, a large area of agricultural and natural landscapes are converted to urban landscapes. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems therefore tend to be significantly disturbed because of increasing human activities, which change the soil processes and reduce the quality and diversity of soil functions such as food production, pollution attenuation, hydrological cycling, and energy balance. The inherent conflicts between urbanization and soil security have been studied for a long time. As urbanization levels in peri-urban ecosystems have increased, soil security problems in peri-urban ecosystems have been a key issue in recent studies. This study reviews published literature concerning soil security in peri-urban ecosystems and aims to contribute to scientific understanding of the interrelations between soil security and urbanization. Statistical analysis showed that the number of published papers concerning peri-urban ecosystems rapidly increased after 2000, especially in the past 5 years. Many studies concerning soil security were focused on urbanization' s influence on soil processes in urban areas, including cropland loss, food production, climate change, and other processes linked with soils. However, only a limited number of studies that focused on peri-urban areas were found. The soil security problems in peri-urban ecosystem areas were often ignored by both rural and urban ecosystems research. In this review, the particularity and complexity of soil security in peri-urban ecosystems are discussed. In summary, we suggest that future peri-urban studies should focus on the following issues: (1) exploring comparative studies at a large scale under different urban sprawl modes, (2) exploring the tradeoff of ecosystem services in the framework of soil security in peri-urban ecosystems, and perspectives on current solutions for soil security in peri-urban ecosystems are proposed, (3) exploring the sources of contaminants in soil and their co-contamination in peri-urban ecosystems, and optimizing landscape patterns to promote soil security and ecosystem services, and (4) considering the sustainable development goals of peri-urban ecosystems and highlighting the multi-dimensional role of soil security in sustainable policy and management. Because soils in peri-urban ecosystems have their own unique set of socioeconomic and ecological features, soil security should be emphasized for understanding the environmental response to global urbanization. © 2018 Science Press.

The limitation of fossil resources as well as linked environmental issues have led to the development of an innovative bioeconomy and also triggered the shift from fossil-based plastics to bio-based plastics. The original motivation for this study was to propose a comprehensive approach to calculate the sustainability performance of bio-based plastics on a global scale. To provide a calculative basis, a review on available data from life cycle assessment (LCA), social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) studies on bio-based plastics was carried out and showed limited availability of quantifiable results with regard to the social and economic performance of bio-based plastics. In environmental LCA, with the ISO-family and related documents, a group of harmonized standards and approaches does exist. However, missing practical and consented guidelines hamper the comparability of studies and the exploitability of data - not only within the bio-based plastic sector but also in comparison to the fossil-based counterparts. Therefore, a calculation for the global sustainability performance of bio-based plastics was merely conducted for the environmental impact category global warming potential. Taking the technical substitution potential of fossil-based with bio-based plastics as well as limitations in data availability into account the estimation was performed for a substitution of approximately two-thirds of the global plastic demand. The results show, that bio-based plastics could potentially save 241 to 316 Mio. t of CO2-eq. annually. Thereby this study gives a first outlook how bio-based plastics could contribute to a sustainable development, making benefits and drawbacks more tangible. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-based plastic; Bioeconomy; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Social life cycle assessment; Sustainability","Economic and social effects; Elastomers; Environmental impact; Global warming; Plastic products; Sustainable development; Bio-based; Bioeconomy; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing; Social life; Life cycle","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85044627001",NA,NA

One of the environmentally friendly possibilities of recycling this type of material is to go through the breaking of their three-dimensional structure. This treatment, called the devulcanization, can be defined as a process that causes the selective breakup of the sulfur-sulfur (S-S) and carbon-sulfur (C-S) chemical bonds without breaking the backbone network and without degrading the material. The devulcanized rubber can be mixed with virgin rubber or with other kinds of matrices to give new compounds without generating a significant decrease in mechanical and physical properties. Many devulcanization process types are presented in the literature: chemical, ultrasound, microwave, thermomechanical, etc. The thermomechanical devulcanization based on extrusion seems to be the more suitable to be applied on an industrial scale. The supercritical CO2 has been proposed as a green atmosphere that can be used to improve this type of devulcanization. In fact, it seems that in supercritical conditions, the CO2 swells the rubber and stretches the sulfide links, making them easier to break. This paper presents a literature review on rubbers recycling by devulcanization. It is focused on the different devulcanization techniques used in the last decades. Particular attention is paid to the thermomechanical method, those in the presence of supercritical CO2 and, finally, the combined thermomechanical process with supercritical CO2 atmosphere. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Devulcanization; Ground tire rubber; Recycling; Supercritical CO2; Waste management","Bond strength (chemical); Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Recycling; Rubber; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Tires; Waste disposal; Devulcanization; Ground tire rubbers; Literature reviews; Mechanical and physical properties; Supercritical CO2; Supercritical condition; Thermomechanical process; Three-dimensional structure; Waste management; carbon; carbon dioxide; rubber; sulfur; supercritical carbon dioxide; unclassified drug; carbon dioxide; recycling; rubber; waste; waste disposal; waste management; Article; chemical bond; chemical procedures; devulcanization; investigative procedures; microwave radiation; recycling; thermomechanical method; ultrasound","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85042877298",NA,NA

Among its benefits is to cover the source of timber, charcoal, woods, herbs, and fish and shrimp culture where all of this can be valued as economic resources. Even with vast benefits it offers, the number of mangrove forests are constantly declining and if there are no actions being taken, the mangrove forests may face the possibility of extinction. Degradation of mangrove forests in Malaysia is mainly due to development and agriculture. A sustainable mangrove forest is not something that is newly introduced in Malaysia as the Matang forest is known for its sustainable forest management for over 100 years. Sustainable mangrove forest programs do not only involve the necessary authorities but also the public as their participation in replanting and managing the mangrove forest. Thus, this study aims to determine the public perception towards sustainable mangrove forest programs in Malaysia. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews with respondents from the states which have high percentage of mangrove forests such as Perak, Sabah, Selangor, Johor, and Pahang. Prior to actual data collection, a pilot study was conducted in Kuala Selangor with 100 respondents. Respondents were selected by using a simple random sampling technique from mangrove and non-mangrove areas with a total of 871 respondents. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive analysis and chi-square analysis. Descriptive analysis has found that the public perception towards the importance of mangrove forest is high with the overall mean score of 4.09. The chi-square analysis revealed that gender, age, education level, income, marital status, and family members have significant relationships with the public perception towards sustainable mangrove forest programs. The insight of this study can help the government and NGOs to organize campaigns and programs related to sustainable mangroves forest more effectively. © Penerbit UMT.","Environment; Mangroves; Perception; Sustainable forest","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85052288843",NA,NA

Valuable metals and minerals are extracted from the geological deposits and ores deep in the surface through complex manufacturing technologies. The extraction and processing of mining industries involve particle emission to air or water, toxicity to the environment, contamination of water resources, ozone layer depletion and most importantly decay of human health. Despite all these negative impacts towards sustainability, mining industries are working throughout the world to facilitate the employment sector, economy and technological growth. The five most important miners in the world are South Africa, Russia, Australia, Ukraine, Guinea. The mining industries contributes to their GDP significantly. However, the most important issue is making the mining world sustainable thus reducing the emissions.

Pakistan is an agricultural land therefore, it is rich in some of the renewable resources of energy like biomass e.g., rice husk, wheat straw and domestic plastic waste that can be utilised to produce power by application ofcertain available technologies. Similarly, use ofplastic waste to produce diesel is increasing day by day and its disposal is going to be a great challenge in future. This research is basically an economic review focusing on the cheap cost of electricity and diesel i f above mentioned renewable resources are utilised. © 2018 PCSIR-Scientific Information Centre.

Our propositions are based on the following arguments: a shift from product ownership to leasing and access in supply chain relationships; the relevance of structural flexibility and start-ups in regional or local loops; open and closed material loops in technical and biological cycles; closer collaboration within and beyond immediate industry boundaries and public and private procurement in the service industry as a lever for the scaling up of circular business models.

The large amount of animal wastes from industrial feedlots cannot be fully used on nearby farmlands, leading to severe environmental problems. Using China as a case study, we found that most dairy feedlots employ a semicoupled mode that only recycles solid manure to farmlands, and only a few dairy feedlots employ a fully coupled mode that recycles both solid and liquid animal manure. To produce 1 ton of milk, the fully coupled mode could reduce greenhouse gas (including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in this paper) emissions by 24%, ammonia emissions by 14%, and N discharge into water by 29%, compared with the semicoupled systems. Coupling feedlots with constructed wetlands can further result in greater mitigation of N leaching into groundwater. However, the fully coupled system has not been widely used due to the low benefit to farmers and the institutional barrier that the feedlot owners have no right to use adjacent farmlands. Since a fully coupled system improves net ecosystem services that favor the public, a policy that supports removing the economic and institutional barriers is necessary. Our approach provides a template for mitigating environmental impacts from livestock production without sacrificing milk production. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","","Animals; Carbon dioxide; Dairies; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Manures; Nitrogen oxides; Wetlands; Ammonia emissions; Animal manure; Constructed wetlands; Ecosystem services; Environmental problems; Institutional barriers; Livestock production; Milk production; Farms; ammonia; carbon dioxide; green manure; ground water; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; agricultural land; constructed wetland; dairy farming; developing world; domestic waste; ecosystem service; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; groundwater; livestock farming; manure; milk production; nitrous oxide; agricultural land; agricultural waste; anaerobic fermentation; Article; carbon footprint; China; constructed wetland; cost benefit analysis; crop production; dairy cattle; ecosystem; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; industrialization; leaching; livestock; manure; milk production; waste management; agricultural land; animal; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; milk; China; Animalia; Animals; China; Ecosystem; Farms; Greenhouse Effect; Manure; Methane; Milk; Nitrous Oxide","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85045006310",NA,NA

Existing methodologies are typically developed considering the specific characteristics of one particular resource type and as consequence are not suitable for cross-cutting assessment of different resource types. This paper proposes an 3-step approach for combining different resource use assessment methodologies allowing for a consistent assessment of product systems using different resource types. The first steps evaluate if the considered dimensions, categories, indicators, indicator models and underlying data are consistent. When this is the case, they can be included in the combined methodology without further adjustments. Differences are identified simultaneously and addressed in the subsequent steps. Within the steps guidance is provided on how the dimensions, categories and indicators of the methodologies can be adjusted to fit in the combined methodology. In a case study the proposed approach is applied to two methodologies developed by the authors assessing abiotic (ESSENZ method) and biotic resources and raw materials (BIRD method). The ESSENZ method consists of four dimensions, which are quantified by overall 21 categories and indicators. The BIRD method takes into account five dimensions and 24 corresponding categories and indicators. As none of the considered dimension of the two methodologies match, comparison of the considered resource types as well as application in a case study is not possible. By applying the proposed approach all five dimensions and 25 of the overall 27 categories and indicators can be integrated in the combined approach for a consistent assessment of abiotic and biotic resources and raw materials. The obtained combined methodology is then applied to three shelves made out of metal, wood and plastic. It could be shown that the introduced approach provides meaningful guidance on how to combine different resource use assessment methodologies and increases the findings gained from a combined and consistent assessment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","BIRD; ESSENZ; Life cycle impact assessment; Resource assessment methodology; Resource use","Birds; Life cycle; Natural resources management; Assessment methodologies; ESSENZ; Life cycle impact assessment; Product systems; Public awareness; Resource assessments; Resource demands; Resource use; Air navigation; abiotic factor; assessment method; biotic factor; demand analysis; environmental impact assessment; environmental indicator; life cycle analysis; resource assessment; resource use; Aves","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85042947918",NA,NA

Fertilizer deep placement, especially urea deep placement (UDP), has been widely recognized as an efficient way to increase rice yield with less N use in flooded rice fields; however, few studies have explored UDP as a way to abate N loss, particularly ammonia (NH3) volatilization, in intensive rice cropping systems. Therefore, a field experiment was performed in the Taihu Region with five treatments (two surface split broadcasting treatments: a current traditional practice with 300 kg N ha−1 (CT) and a reduced N practice with 225 kg N ha−1 (RN), two one-time UDP treatments: a current traditional practice under UDP (CTDP) and a reduced N practice under UDP (RNDP), and a CK treatment with no urea). The NH3 volatilization, grain yield and N use efficiency in terms of the N recovery efficiency (NRE) were investigated during the 2014–2016 rice growing seasons. Additionally, N diffusion and 15N-labeled urea experiments were conducted to explore the N release pattern and the fate of 15N under UDP. The results demonstrated that little NH4 +-N could diffuse into surface water under UDP, thus, negligible floodwater NH4 +-N was detected. The seasonally cumulative NH3 volatilization of the UDP accounted for only 1% of the total applied N, which decreased by 91% compared to surface broadcasting treatments. As a result, the NH3 intensity (NH3-N loss per crop yield) was reduced by 92% over surface broadcasting. Moreover, the deep placement of urea could supply a higher NH4 +-N concentration in the soil during the early growth stage and prolong the duration of N availability for 2 months; as a result, UDP remarkably increased the N uptake by 28% compared with surface broadcasting treatments in the 3 years. The UDP treatments significantly increased the yield and NRE by 10% and 55% under favorable weather conditions (2015 and 2016 rice seasons), respectively. The RNDP treatment obtained the lowest N surplus (36 kg N ha−1), and the plant 15N uptake was 62% higher and the 15N loss was 38% lower with RNDP than surface broadcasting. Therefore, the deep placement of urea can be considered a slow release fertilizer, which better matches the N demand of rice plants and effectively minimizes N losses, especially NH3 volatilization. The RNDP treatment, with a 25% reduction in the N dose, can represent an effective and promising strategy to achieve environmental integrity and food security in intensive rice cropping systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","15N uptake; Ammonia volatilization; N diffusion; N use efficiency","ammonia; cropping practice; diffusion; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; rice; urea; volatilization","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85017164111",NA,NA

As a result, there has been substantial interest in iron-fertilizing high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) areas in an effort to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. More recently, research has shifted to quantifying the beneficial effects of iron recycling by marine biota. Marine top predators such as whales and seabirds have been examined specifically in this regard as they have high biomass, form dense aggregations, and excrete bioavailable iron in concentrations seven orders of magnitude higher than ambient seawater. Despite it being well established that marine fauna link the iron and carbon cycles, the connection of this process to the sulfur cycle has rarely been considered. The chemoattraction of specific marine fauna to algal-derived dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is key in triggering dense, multi-species foraging aggregations that induce iron recycling, augmenting carbon assimilation. The goal of this paper is twofold; first, to highlight DMS chemoattraction as a behavior that catalyzes carbon sequestration via natural iron fertilization, and second, to identify knowledge gaps that recent biogeochemical advances can address. Fostering this interdisciplinary research will enhance our understanding of global climate regulation, ecosystem services provided by marine top predators, and the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, iron, and sulfur in HNLC waters. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon cycle; Community ecology; Dimethyl sulfide; Iron cycle; Marine biogeochemistry; Polar biology; Top predators","biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; catalysis; climate change; community ecology; concentration (composition); dimethylsulfide; ecosystem service; fauna; global climate; marine environment; predator; sulfur; sulfur cycle; Southern Ocean; algae; Cetacea","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85043391104",NA,NA

Besides beneficial effects on crop yield and quality, possible adverse environmental effects associated with plastic mulch are currently under debate. Aside from the obvious disadvantages of substantial amounts of (micro)plastic waste, adverse effects on soil quality and biodiversity might be assumed. We compared the effect of plastic mulch and organic mulch (straw) systems in strawberry cultivation on soil invertebrates and biological activity in an observational field study in the Upper Rhine valley, Germany. Soil invertebrates were collected using pitfall traps and Berlese-Tullgren-funnels, earthworms by hand sorting. Soil biological activity was determined using bait-lamina sticks and the MicroResp™ system. Soil samples from test fields were analysed for physicochemical and microbial parameters. Despite minor effects on soil physicochemical parameters, our results showed that the mulch system had a significant effect on the community structure of soil invertebrates. In strawberry fields with plastic mulch we found a decreased taxonomic richness and taxonomic richness decreased with increasing soil temperature. About 50% of the analysed taxa had significantly lower abundances in plastic mulched fields compared to fields with organic mulch. No investigated taxon had a higher abundance in plastic mulched fields. Soil moisture was the most important environmental variable in explaining invertebrate abundances. The soil microbial activity was significantly lower in plastic mulched fields than in fields with organic mulch. Our results indicate that even little shifts in abiotic (e.g. temperature, water content) and biotic (e.g. food availability) conditions associated with the plastic mulch system can have strong effects on soil invertebrates and soil microbial activity. Hence, plastic mulch might pose a threat to soil biodiversity and related ecosystem functions in agroecosystems. We call for further studies analysing the influence of plasticulture, to better evaluate the long-term consequences on agrobiodiversity and soil quality as well as sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural intensification; Organic mulch; Plastic mulch; Soil fauna","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85039442755",NA,NA

It has already been recognised that the recovery of these elements is critical for the sustainability of a number of industries and SRM recovery from anthropogenic waste deposits represents a significant opportunity. In this study, the characterisation of the different waste fractions and the amount of SRM that can potentially be recovered from two landfill sites in Finland is presented. The first site was a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill site and it was specifically investigated for its metals, SRM, plastics, wood, paper, and cardboard content as well as its fine fraction (<20 mm). The second site was an industrial landfill site containing residual wastes from industrial processes including 1) aluminium salt slag from refining process of aluminium scrap and 2) shredding residues from automobiles, household appliances and other metals containing waste. This site was investigated for its metals and SRM recovery potential as well as its fine fraction. Results suggest that the fine fraction offers opportunities for metal (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and SRM extraction and recovery from both landfill site types while the chemical composition of the industrial waste landfill offered greater opporutinity as it was comparable to typical aluminium salt slags. Nevertheless, the concentrations of rare earth metals (REE) and other valuable elements were low even in comparison with the concentrations found in the Earth’s crust. Therefore mining landfill sites only for their metals or SRM content is not expected to be financially viable. However, other opportunities, such as waste-derived fuels from excavated materials especially at MSW landfill sites, still exists and fosters the application and feasibility of landfill mining. © 2018 Cisa Publisher.","Extractive waste; Landfill mining; Municipal solid waste; Rare earth elements; Secondary raw materials","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85079665870",NA,NA

Thus, China's modern agriculture is rooted in a long evolutionary history of agricultural practices. China's population of 211 million in 1700 increased to 295 million in 1800, 400 million in 1900, 1266 million in 2000, and is 1409 million in 2017. Thus, China has to feed 18.5% of the world population on merely 7% of the world's arable land and with even scarcer water resources. Yet, between 1950 and 2017, the grain production in China increased at a faster rate than that of the population. Total grain production (million ton or Tg) was 113 in 1949, 305 in 1970, 462 in 2000, and 603 in 2015. The high agricultural productivity is attributed to high consumption of fertilizers (58.8 Tg in 2015), pesticides (1.81 Tg in 2014), and irrigation (65.7 Mha in 2014). However, the high production is also associated with the severe problems of soil degradation (erosion), water contamination and air pollution. It is estimated that ~40% of China's arable land is degraded to some degree. Thus, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift of sustaining high productivity while restoring quality of natural resources of soil, water and air. In this context, conversion to a system-based conservation agriculture (CA) may be an important strategy of sustainable intensification of agro-ecosystems for advancing and sustaining high production while restoring soil health, purifying water and air and improving the environment. The CA has been practiced in China since 1990s and was adopted on ~8.0 Mha in 2015. The available literature shows that conversion to CA increases soil organic C (SOC) concentration and stocks mostly in the surface layer while also producing an equivalent agronomic yield. Therefore, a widespread adoption of CA in China would necessitate a deeper understanding of its ecological underpinnings. To be effective, site-specific CA practices must reduce risks of soil erosion under dry land farming, achieve and sustain high productivity, reduce emissions of N2O and CH4, sequester SOC, and decrease inputs of fertilizers and pesticides. To be widely accepted, site-specific CA packages must also address the followings: availability of crop residues mulch, techniques of weed control, access to a seed drill, and availability of farm labor. Economically, CA must increase agronomic yield and the farm profit. Being a knowledge-intensive and complex system, there is a strong need to strengthen the extension services, and conduct long-term and farmer-driven research to alleviate specific constraints (e.g., drought, wind and water erosion, nutrient imbalance, weed control). © 2018 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power Press","ancient agriculture; environmental pollution; food security; soil conservation; water scarcity","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85041910965",NA,NA

The global warming potential (GWP) of single operations during a fresh fruit production under local conventional management (Cmng) and the mitigation potential of introducing sustainable management practices (Smng) were assessed. A life cycle assessment analysis (ISO 14067) was performed for the whole life cycle of pilot apricot and peach orchards in Southern Italy (3 sites), taking into account greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions related to all annual agricultural operations, orchard establishment and removal. Results revealed that fertilization shared the highest fraction of GWP (from 22.4% to 60.5%) among all agricultural operations in both Cmng and Smng scenarios. The adoption of Smng had a reduction of GWP ranging from 1% to 17%. When accounting for SOC change (modelled through Roth-C) after the Smng application and for recycling the permanent biomass of trees at the end-of-life of the orchard, the GWP can become negative ranging from approx. −0.8 to −4.2 kg CO2 eq. per ton of fruit. The estimated average mitigation potential of adopting Smng practices was −2.7 t CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1, and derives mostly from soil carbon storage capacity. The adoption of Smng practices could be considered within GHGs mitigation policies for the agricultural sector, if assessed at landscape level. Composting, as a possible scenario for the disposal of the tree biomass at the end of the orchard life cycle, results to have a higher GWP impact than burning it for home heating purposes. However, the improvement of soil quality and of the related ecosystem services of using compost for agricultural purposes should promote the spread of composting practices and the multiplication of composting facilities in Southern Italy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fruit tree crops; Greenhouse gases; Land management change; Life cycle assessment; Soil carbon change; Standing biomass","Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Composting; Crops; Ecosystems; Farms; Forestry; Fruits; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Orchards; Soils; Agricultural operations; Fruit trees; Global warming potential; Land managements; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle assessment analysis; Soil carbon; Sustainable management; Life cycle","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85038826366",NA,NA

This “tradition” is both embedded into our instincts as well as a mode of behavior and a learnt method of survival in our societies. However, alongside with the globalization of the economy, internationalization, industrialization and population growth, the consequences of the one-sided approach of the past have become unbearable for the environment. Consequently, in order to maintain life on earth in its current form, we should establish new thinking and modes of action. Therefore, the survival strategies for Mankind should inherently contain the strive for sustainability, as well as the tendency to avoid past mistakes, and to repair them instantaneously whenever possible. The agricultural tradition of different nations leans on the centuries old wisdom of human civilization in a good sense. For example, the East Asian agricultural societies have learnt to handle each piece of land in their possession in an individual manner, taking into account the local environmental conditions. These principles are now more and more unanimously accepted, at least in theory. Also, the industrial ecosystem needs to be functioning in the natural way, and in balance with the environment. This is a necessity in the reversion or prevention of any developing environmental catastrophes that could wait behind the corner. As the major vehicles for the circulation of matter, microbes are in a key position and provide means for finding the solutions to serve the global ecosystems. In the aftermath of a vast environmental crisis, namely the oil leakage from the “Deepwater Horizon” oil platform well in the Mexican Gulf in the year 2010, it was noticed that the dramatic consequences of the spill were mitigated and the worst scenario of destruction avoided thanks to the cleaning actions of the marine micro-organisms. This was a positive result both ecologically and in economic sense. It further encouraged the scientists to find and isolate microbial strains which could be used for such operations. Although the natural microflora compensated and mitigated the effects of the Deepwater Horizon accident surprisingly well in 2010, there have been observations and concerns about the long term effects of this ecocatastroph (Geggel, 2015). © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85048411356",NA,NA

In the circular economy (CE) context, scientific literature has already identified the lack of overarching indicators (social, urban, prevention-oriented, etc.), pointing out that mono-dimensional indicators are not able to grasp the complexity of the systemic, closed-loop, feedback features of CE. In this respect, Emergy accounting is one of the approaches that have been identified as holding the potential to capture both resource generation and product delivery dimensions and therefore to provide an enhanced systems' evaluation in a CE perspective. Because of Emergy's intrinsic definition and its calculation structure, Emergy-based indicators conceptually lend themselves very well to the evaluation and monitoring of circular processes. Additionally, Emergy has the unique feature of enabling the evaluation of systems that are not necessarily only technosphere systems, but also of technological systems which embed nature (techno-ecological systems). The present paper gives a perspective on a set of Emergy-based indicators that we have identified as suitable to evaluate circular systems, and outlines the different perspective compared to the circularity indicators defined in the ""Circularity Indicators Project"" launched by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. © 2019 Mineral and Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

This research work applies a composite indicator that has been developed as the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems Index to benchmark the performance of a new sample of 26 world cities. The sample advances the geographical diversity of previous samples and represents cities in the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy as well as the C40 initiative. The benchmarking results are analysed based on quartiles of city performance and Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate the top three cities in the sample to be Copenhagen, which obtains a score of 36.038, followed by Helsinki and Gothenburg. The top cities represent multiple best practices including those in district energy networks, water quality, and environmental management. A normative scenario up to the year 2050 is then applied to one of the cities in the sample, namely Rio de Janeiro. The normative scenario involves targets that take place in local plans, particularly Vision Rio 500. The benchmarking results for the new sample of 26 world cities and the normative scenario not only identifies the benchmark leaders but also underlines opportunities to pursue pathways in which higher levels of performance can be reached by cities that may face multiple challenges. The results of the research work holds significance for advancing the application of an original composite indicator to benchmark cities towards supporting the aim of decoupling economic growth from environmental pressures in more sustainable urban systems towards carbon neutrality. © 2018, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

We also try to associate living organisms to the soil aggregates they generate, furnishing photographs of organisms and aggregates visible in the field even with a naked eye. The transformation of dead bodies, organs or cells and droppings in the soil ecosystem is influenced by biotic and abiotic factors and hence it must be considered as a dynamic, never ending, local evolution.

The experiment was a randomized factorial design with five intra-row treatments (crushed glass mulch [CG], distillers' grain mulch [DG], creeping red fescue [CRF], non-sprayed control [NSC], and glyphosate [GLY]) and three inter-row treatments (creeping red fescue [CRF], Kentucky bluegrass [KB], and resident vegetation [RV]). Treatments were established in 2010-2011 and measurements were conducted during 2012 and 2013 on 5-and 6-year- old vines. Soil temperatures were mostly higher under mulches and lower under intra- row groundcovers, compared to GLY. Weed cover in CG, DG, and CRF treatments was the same or less than GLY. At most sampling dates, inter-row soil moisture was lowest under KB. Intra-row soil moisture was highest under DG mulch and lowest under CRF and NSC; CG had the same or lower soil moisture than GLY. Surprisingly, we did not detect differences in mid-day photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reflectance, despite visual differences among the intra-row treatments. Mid-day vine water potential did not differ among treatments. We concluded it is not necessary to maintain a bare soil strip under established vines in this region, where soil fertility and moisture are non-limiting. © 2018 Bavougian and Read.","Glyphosate; Groundcover; Mulch; Vegetative vigor; Vineyard floor management; Weed control","glyphosate; organic matter; Amaranthus retroflexus; Article; canopy; Capsella bursapastoris; chemical analysis; chemical composition; Chenopodium album; controlled study; Eleusine indica; evapotranspiration; fescue; germination; grape; mulch; nonhuman; photosynthetically active radiation; Poa pratensis; reflectometry; soil moisture; soil temperature; soil treatment; soil water content; stem water potential; Taraxacum officinale; thermometry; vegetation; vineyard; weed control","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85049241040",NA,NA

However, culturing of species in the marine environment implies multiple interactions between farmed species and their environment. This has led to concerns over the ecological effects of aquaculture, which include benthic organic loading, changes to water quality, habitat modification, disease spread, and introduction of exotic or invasive species, interaction with wild species, coastal eutrophication, and marine litter. Over the years, governments and international organizations have recognized the need to identify, mitigate, and reduce these ecological effects. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations proposes an Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture (EAA), which implies recognizing its effects at multiple spatial scales, including near-field effect (farm scale) and far-field (bay scale and global scale) effect. This chapter reviews ecological effects of finfish, bivalve, and seaweed aquaculture in marine coastal waters, and describes the mitigation efforts currently used to improve its sustainable management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors find these solutions in the arenas of renewable energy systems, agroecological methods, and reimagined social organization. Clarity is brought to the political economic obstacles standing in the way as well as the false solutions and alleged barriers that pervade the discourse thereby delaying and obstructing progress to the solutions advanced. The authors provoke readers to face up to these challenges by demonstrating how people, all over the world, have already begun this effort through collective action ranging from the local to the global community. Drawing on their own and many other scholar's research, they reject a reliance on the ""business as usual"" approach trusting the capitalist market and existing global institutions, and provide an accessible popular account with thoroughly footnoted endnotes that contain technical details and references to the scientific literature.

Carrier bags manufactured from non-biodegradable polymers constitute a large component of this litter. Because of their adverse impact on marine life, non-biodegradable bags have recently been replaced by biodegradable ones. However, growing evidence shows that these latter are not readily degradable in marine sediments and can alter benthic assemblages. The potential impact of biodegradable bags on seagrasses inhabiting sandy bottoms, which are the most widespread and productive ecosystems of the coastal zones, has been ignored. Mesocosm experiments were conducted to assess the effect of a commercialized biodegradable bag on a common seagrass species of the Mediterranean, Cymodocea nodosa, both at the level of individual plant (clonal growth) and of plant community (plant-plant relationships), under three culture regimes (plant alone, in combination with a neighbour of the same species or of the co-existing seagrass Zostera noltei) simulating different natural conditions (bare substrate, monospecific meadows or mixed meadows). The bag behaviour in marine sediment and sediment physical/chemical variables were also examined. After six months of sediment exposure, the bag retained considerable mass (85% initial weight) and reduced sediment pore-water oxygen concentration and pH. In the presence of bag, C. nodosa root spread and vegetative recruitment increased compared to controls, both intra- and interspecific interactions shifted from neutral to competitive, and the growth form changed from guerrilla (loosely arranged group of widely spaced ramets) to phalanx form (compact structure of closed spaced ramets) but only with Z. noltei. These findings suggest that biodegradable bags altering sediment geochemistry could promote the spatial segregation of seagrass clones and influence species coexistence. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biodegradable plastic; Marine environment; Plant interaction; Seagrasses; Sediments","Biodegradable polymers; Coastal zones; Plants (botany); Plastic containers; Submarine geology; Biodegradable plastics; Interspecific interactions; Marine environment; Non-biodegradable polymers; Oxygen concentrations; Plant interactions; Seagrasses; Sediment geochemistries; Sediments; biodegradable plastic; oxygen; biodegradable plastic; biodegradation; coexistence; ecosystem response; marine sediment; plant community; plastic waste; seafloor; seagrass meadow; Article; biogeochemistry; controlled study; Cymodocea nodosa; nonhuman; oxygen concentration; pH; plant root; priority journal; sea pollution; seagrass; sediment; species coexistence; Zostera noltei; Alismatales; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; Mediterranean Sea; water pollution; Mediterranean Sea; Cymodocea nodosa; Zostera; Alismatales; Biodegradable Plastics; Ecosystem; Geologic Sediments; Mediterranean Sea; Plant Roots; Water Pollution","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85021404085",NA,NA

Technology transfer and the adoption of low-tech protected cultivation techniques affordable for smallholders are believed to be able to meet this challenge. Protected cultivation techniques are a set of agricultural practices aimed at artificializing the crop environment through the use of soil covers and/or plant covers to control pests and climatic conditions. Although protected cultivation techniques may increase the yield and quality of vegetable crops and extend their production periods worldwide, the transfer of these techniques in sub-Saharan Africa raises questions about their agronomical performances, their profitability but also their environmental impacts. Are low-tech protected cultivation techniques adapted to the sustainable production of vegetables by smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa? To answer this question, we present an overview of the agronomic, economic, and environmental performances of low-tech protected cultivation techniques in sub-Saharan Africa as reported in the literature. The major conclusions that can be drawn from the review are (1) low-tech protected cultivation techniques are not suitable in all climatic conditions in sub-Saharan Africa and need to be combined with other methods to ensure adequate pest control, (2) the profitability of protected cultivation techniques relies on the capacity to offset increased production costs by higher yields and higher selling prices to be obtained with off-season and/or higher quality products, (3) breaking with existing cropping systems, the lack of technical support and skills, and the limited access to investment funding are major obstacles to the adoption of protected cultivation techniques by smallholders (4) life cycle assessments conducted in northern countries suggested that more efficient use of agricultural inputs would offset the negative impacts of protected cultivation techniques if they are properly managed, but further studies are required to be sure these results can be extrapolated to sub-Saharan Africa context. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS.","Greenhouse; Insect pests; Life cycle assessment; Netting; Profitability; Quality; Tunnel","agricultural technology; agronomy; climate conditions; crop pest; crop production; crop yield; cropping practice; cultivation; greenhouse ecosystem; insect; investment; life cycle analysis; profitability; qualitative analysis; smallholder; technology adoption; technology transfer; tunnel; vegetable; vegetation cover; Sub-Saharan Africa; Hexapoda","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85032008137",NA,NA

A significant fraction of this leakage originates from coastal cities, particularly during extreme rainfall events. As coastal cities continue to grow, finding ways to reduce this macroplastic leakage is extremely pertinent. Here, we explore why and how coastal cities can reduce macroplastic leakages during extreme rainfall events. Using nine global cities as a basis, we establish that while cities actively create policies that reduce plastic leakages, more needs to be done. Nonetheless, these policies are economically, socially and environmentally cobeneficial to the city environment. While the lack of political engagement and economic concerns limit these policies, lacking social motivation and engagement is the largest limitation towards implementing policy. We recommend cities to incentivize citizen and municipal engagement with responsible usage of plastics, cleaning the environment and preparing for future extreme rainfall events. © 2017 The Author(s)","Coastal environments; Marine plastic; Urban policy","Contamination; Marine pollution; Coastal environments; Economic concerns; Environmental problems; Extreme rainfall; Marine environment; Marine plastics; Social motivations; Urban policy; Rain; plastic; rain; coastal zone management; extreme event; leakage; marine environment; plastic waste; policy implementation; rainfall; urban policy; Article; Australia; Brazil; Canada; city planning; Denmark; economic aspect; environmental management; environmental policy; Hong Kong; human; India; motivation; politics; quality of life; sea pollution; seashore; Singapore; smoking; United States; urban area; waste management; water management; city; legislation and jurisprudence; particle size; prevention and control; water pollution; Cities; Environmental Policy; Humans; Particle Size; Plastics; Rain; Water Pollution, Chemical","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85026214199",NA,NA

This partial approach often delivers misleading messages for policy- and decision-makers. It fails to accurately represent systems complexity, and obscures impacts, trade-offs and problem shifting that resource recovery processes or systems intended to promote circular economy may cause. Here, we challenge such partial approaches by critically reviewing the existing suite of environmental, economic, social and technical metrics that have been regularly observed and used in waste management and resource recovery systems' assessment studies, upstream and downstream of the point where waste is generated. We assess the potential of those metrics to evaluate ‘complex value’ of materials, components and products, i.e., the holistic sum of their environmental, economic, social and technical benefits and impacts across the system. Findings suggest that the way resource recovery systems are assessed and evaluated require simplicity, yet must retain a suitable minimum level of detail across all domains of value, which is pivotal for enabling sound decision-making processes. Criteria for defining a suitable set of metrics for assessing resource recovery from waste require them to be simple, transparent and easy to measure, and be both system- and stakeholder-specific. Future developments must focus on providing a framework for the selection of metrics that accurately describe (or at least reliably proxy for) benefits and impacts across all domains of value, enabling effective and transparent analysis of resource recovery form waste in circular economy systems. © 2017 The Authors","Circular economy; Material flow analysis; Metrics; Multi-dimensional value; Resource recovery; Solid waste management; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability indicators","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Natural resources; Recovery; Solid wastes; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Material flow analysis; Metrics; Multi dimensional; Resource recovery; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability indicators; Waste management","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85028518706",NA,NA

The effect of individuals’ concerns about the environmental sustainability of their consumption patterns has not only received increased attention from market participants but also from academics. Existing literature which focuses specifically on investments in renewable energies points out that individuals’ attitudes are good predictors or moderators of ecologically friendly investment behavior. This study aims to investigate those factors which influence retail investors’ attitudes towards investments in renewable energies. The results are based on an online-survey of participants in Germany and reveal that individuals’ social norms, their confidence in NGOs, and their evaluation of the relevant regulatory framework significantly influence their attitudes towards investments in renewable energies. Based on a multiple linear regression, it was found that the conceptual model used explains 49% of individuals’ attitudes.

The experimental fertilizer formulas included also rape oil used as a plasticizer for controlling the nutrients release from the fertiliser. Mustard (Sinapis alba L.), oats (Avena sativa sp. L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and cress (Lepidium sativum L.) were used as test plants species in the experiment. The toxicity tests were performed using a standard procedure of 72 h with the use of Phytotoxkit microbiotest and fertilizer application of 2.5; 5 and 10% (v/v). The obtained results indicated an increase of acute toxicity for all tested plant species, proportionally to the applied doses of the fertilizer. During the 72 h period, the strongest inhibition of seedling growth was recorded in samples consisting of 10% of the tested fertilizers, particularly when they showed considerable level of salinity or low pH values. From the tested plant species, cress (Lepidium sativum L.) turned out to be the most sensitive to the applied fertilizers, the least was cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) for which only a small inhibition of root system growth was observed. The inhibited growth of roots could be attributed to a reduced oxygen access and excessive salinity of the substratum caused by the applied additives. © 2017 Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) in Warsaw; © 2017 Institute of Technology and Life Sciences (ITP) in Falenty.","acute toxicity; blood meal; organic fertilizer; spent coffee ground","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85032721261",NA,NA

To that end, a systematic literature review was executed, through which 102 published articles were analyzed with the aim to, initially, comprehend the concept of Zero Waste, and, then, map its benefits, challenges, and critical success factors. The results show that scholars have not reached a consensus regarding the concept of ZW. While some studies fully address this philosophy, other studies are based on just one or on some of its topics. The benefits were grouped and organized into four dimensions: benefits to the community, financial-economic benefits, benefits to the environment and benefits to the industry and stakeholders. As to the challenges, barriers were identified both in the macro environment (mainly political and cultural) and in the meso and micro environments (stakeholders, industries, and municipalities). The analysis of the articles enabled listing critical success factors, supported by a set of activities that must be carried out. Regarding future studies, it is worth noting that more empirical studies about ZW implementation are necessary, particularly with regard to educational practices designed to promote changes in user behavior. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Recycling and reuse; Waste management; Waste mitigation; Waste reduction","Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Critical success factor; Empirical studies; Financial economics; Holistic approach; Literature reviews; Microenvironments; Systematic literature review; Waste reduction; Waste management; holistic approach; literature review; recycling; solid waste; waste management; biodiversity; economic development; ecosystem; government; landfill; life cycle assessment; philosophy; priority journal; recycling; Review; solid waste management; thermodynamics; waste disposal; zero waste; city; human; solid waste; waste management; Cities; Humans; Solid Waste; Waste Management","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85019732200",NA,NA

As fossil resources are limited, and the use of such resources is a major contributor to global warming and other environmental impacts, the potential of bio-products as substitutes for fossil-based products is receiving much attention. According to many LCA studies, bio-products are environmentally superior to fossil products in some life cycle impact categories, while the picture is often opposite in others. Bio-products is a highly diverse group of products and the environmental profile of bio-products relative to their fossil counterparts is case specific and to a high degree depending on the feedstock used. This illustrates the importance of conducting case specific LCAs for determining the environmental profile of bio-products relative to fossil ones, and emphasises the importance of including all relevant impact categories, in order to avoid problem shifting. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","","","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85037645726",NA,NA

Unfortunately, some of these methods have given rise to perverse socio-environmental effects; as materials have been unnecessarily sacrificed, mines and wells have opened and plantations grown, in the name of energy saving. This paper contributes to clean energy-orientated policies and practices by exploring the discipline of sustainable materials. We first review two strategies: energy efficiency linked to materials; and material efficiency, meaning ""doing more with less."" We find that, although both contribute significantly, they are hampered by the rebound effect and their focus on ""doing less bad"" rather than ""good"". Furthermore, they do not in themselves evaluate the services and societal wellbeing that materials provide. We then define ""material services"" and propose a wider strategy that encompasses and enhances the previous two. Under the new strategy, we argue that sustainable materials should be considered as those that do no harm and which optimally, through the services provided, contribute to better sustainable development policies and practices. © 2017 by the authors.","Material consumption; Material efficiency; Material footprint; Material stock; Service efficiency; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable materials","","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85028300031",NA,NA

Despite some attention across urban studies, the need to interrogate how new forms of urban carbon governance are transforming infrastructure space remains pressing. This paper examines the low-carbon restructuring of the waste system in Mbale, Uganda, a town struggling to address its socio-ecological futures. The paper asserts that a UPE approach to how urban carbon governance is materialised advances three particular concerns; the governing of urban circulation, carbon capital and socio-material relations. Through examining these, the paper shows how global actors are increasingly involved in low-carbon transformation, use places such as Mbale as spaces of experimentation and dominate the governing of this restructuring. Yet out of such unjust processes new forms of contestation and low-carbon politics may emerge. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","climate change; low-carbon; Urban infrastructure; urban political ecology; waste","climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; infrastructure; pollution tax; urban politics; urban region; urbanization; waste management; Mbale; Uganda","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85021175964",NA,NA

India’s food grain production of 273.4 million tonnes (Mt) in 2017 has to be increased from lesser arable land area, lower fertilizer use and reduced consumption of water for supplementary irrigation. Furthermore, degraded soils, affecting land area of 114.2 million hectare (Mha), must be restored and risks of any new soil degradation minimized. In this context, the importance of recycling bio-wastes (e.g., agricultural, municipal and industrial) to restore soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration and stock and improve soil health cannot be over-emphasized. Crop residues, 510-836 Tg yr-1. are a major source of C, plant nutrients, biofuels and industrial raw materials. Rather than in-field burning and used as traditional fuel, composting and using as mulch can reduce risks of erosion and improve soil health. Similarly, dung production in India, also a rich source of C and nutrients, must be recycled as manure and used in bioreactors to produce methane. Wasted grains, fruits and vegetables must also be composted and used as a soil amendments. Judicious use of bio-wastes can re-carbonize the biosphere, restore degraded soils and improve soil health, produce biofuels and other value addition industrial byproducts, and improve the environment. Conservative estimates of additional soil C sequestration by judicious management of crop residues and animal dung are 24 Tg C yr-1 worth US 3.0 billion of revenue for farmers and land managers from payments for ecosystem services. There is a strong need of enhancing the awareness about proper disposal and use of bio-wastes through environmental education in primary and secondary schools, and communication by IT services. Recycling of bio-wastes is also critical to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals of the U.N.

This was tested using lichen transplants as biomonitors in a Mediterranean regional area with high levels of dry deposition. After a multivariate analysis, we have modeled the maximum pollution load expected for each site taking into consideration nearby pollutant sources. The difference between maximum expected pollution load and the observed values was explained by the deposition in nearby forests.

The application of mulching practices reduces soil evaporation, conserves soil moisture, suppresses weed growth, controls soil structure and temperature, influences soil micro-organisms, and is aesthetically pleasing. This study has reviewed 189 published research papers, which described the effects of various mulching materials and methods on soil and environment that influence crop productivity. This paper describes the extent of influence of different mulching materials and methods on the hydrothermal environment of soils. It is imperative to know the processes that control soil environments under various mulching conditions and the effects of mulching materials on crop yield, productivity and water use efficiency. These issues of mulching are the prime concerns of this review study. Plastic mulching materials have a greater importance than the organic ones to control soil environment and increase crop yield. But, the organic mulching materials are inexpensive and environment friendly. The selection of an appropriate mulching material is, however, guided by crop type, crop management practices and climatic conditions. Future research is needed on the effects of low-cost biodegradable mulching materials on microclimate modifications, soil biota, soil fertility, crop growth and crop yields. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Mulch; Soil micro-organism; Soil moisture; Soil productivity; Soil temperature","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Microorganisms; Moisture; Productivity; Soil moisture; Crop management practices; Environment friendly; Hydrothermal environment; Mulch; Soil micro-organisms; Soil productivity; Soil temperature; Water use efficiency; Soils; crop production; crop yield; microclimate; mulch; mulching; soil ecosystem; soil microorganism; soil moisture; soil structure; soil temperature; water use efficiency","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85011903663",NA,NA

In order to examine the adaptability of eelgrass to different environmental stresses, studies on the morphology and reproductive capacity of eelgrass had been carried out monthly from November 2014 to October 2015 at four different habitats of the Swan Lake, including patch area in intertidal area and subtidal area, eelgrass meadow edge, and eelgrass meadow area. The results showed significant spatio-temporal variations in the morphological parameters and branch frequency of eelgrass shoots at different habitats of the Swan Lake. The highest values of leaf length, leaf width, aboveground/belowground biomass, and internode length/diameter were observed in the meadow area, i.e., 78.54 cm, 7.93 mm, 7.03 and 3.88, respectively, while the highest branch frequency was observed in the meadow edge (88.4%). The plasticity index for aboveground/belowground biomass was higher (ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) at the four habitats, but those for the leaf width was slightly lower (ranging from 0.41 to 0.64). The number of spathes in each shoot showed no significant difference at different habitats, whereas the number of spathes per unit area was significantly different. Clonal reproduction was more dominant in meadow area than in the patch area where human disturbance was high. © 2017, Science Press.

In such markets, actors design compromises as they encounter criticisms of and contending justifications for the market’s products, as these refer to price, efficiency in production and use, regulatory compliance or ecological sustainability. Tests and justifications are vital in order to determine what is valuable and by which measure. As a theory framework, the economic sociology of conventions provides a basis for assessing these contests, compromises, and justifications over the issue of worth in a marketing context. Through an ethnographic study of the regulated activities of chemicals service companies supporting the upstream petroleum industry, we assess how actors evaluate and justify the market’s products and services in this environmentally sensitive setting by means of tests drawing from different orders of worth: the green, the industrial and the market order. Our contributions show that by artful and pragmatic compromising around exchanges, actors in marketing systems can balance several conflicting orders of worth over the question of worth without needing to converge on an overriding institutional logic. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Compromise; economics of convention; environmental markets; market systems; orders of worth; sustainability; valuation studies","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85014666687",NA,NA

However, the resource depletion and pollution emissions involved in recycling and manufacturing processes also have negative impacts on nature. To solve this problem, we focused on the waste paper recycling system in order to build an ecological costs model based on material flow analysis, and to provide a basis for optimizing the waste recycling system. In this paper, we define the concepts of ecological costs and sum up the existing researches on these, and ensure that counting ecological costs based on material flow analysis is practical. Ecological costs are cause by resource consumption, waste emissions in the processes of recycling, manufacturing, etc. , and they are divided into the three categories: resource depletion, environmental pollution and protection, and ecological damage. Pollution yield and environmental protection costs are counted by allocating total manufacturing costs into positive and negative products, and then counting resource depletion and ecological damage costs using the LIME method. Total ecological costs in the recycling system are calculated by summing every ecological costs in the whole system. Although ecological cost accounting is an important means of evaluating the ecological load, the constitution of ecological costs for the waste paper system is depicted using the foundation of the material flow chart. The model we built is not only fit for the waste paper recycling system, but also valid for other waste products. In addition, this model counts the ecological costs and finds out the manufacturing progresses with high ecological impacts, thereby improving them and providing the basis for both environmental and economic benefits; thus, it constitutes an efficient waste recycling system. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

Drawing on an extraordinarily diverse range of sources and informed by creative practice, Design for Life penetrates to the heart of modern culture and the malaise that underlies today’s moral and environmental crises. The author argues that this malaise is deep-seated and fundamental to the modern outlook. He shows how our preoccupation with technological progress, growth and the future has produced a constricted view of life - one that is both destructive and self-reinforcing. Based on over twenty-five years of scholarship and creative practice, he demonstrates the vital importance of solitude, contemplation, inner growth and the present moment in developing a different course - one that looks squarely at our current, precarious situation while offering a positive, hopeful way forward - a way that is compassionate, context-based, human scale, ethically motivated and critically creative. Design for Life is an intensely original contribution that will be essential reading for design practitioners and students. Written in a clear, accessible style, it will also appeal to a broader readership, especially anyone who is concerned with contemporary society’s rising inequalities and environmental failings and is looking for a more constructive, balanced and thoughtful direction. © 2017 Stuart Walker.","","","Book","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85021931624",NA,NA

However, the availability of biotic materials has not been analyzed to this extent yet. Therefore, an approach to determine possible limitations to availability of terrestrial biotic materials over the entire supply chain is introduced. The approach considers 24 categories overall as well as associated category indicators for the five dimensions: physical, socio-economic, abiotic, social and environmental constraints. This ensures a comprehensive availability assessment of bio-based product systems. The approach is applied to a case study comparing biodiesel produced from rapeseed and soy beans. The study shows that the determination of indicator values is feasible for most categories and their interpretation leads to meaningful conclusions. Thus, the approach leads to a more comprehensive assessment of availability aspects and supports better informed decision making in industry and policy. © 2017 by the authors.","Biotic materials; Life cycle assessment; Resource availability; Socio-economic availability; Supply risk","biofuel; biogenic material; canola; decision making; environmental constraint; industrial production; life cycle analysis; resource availability; socioeconomic conditions; soybean; supply chain management; Brassica napus","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85011286646",NA,NA

It lays out policies for what is considered the major environmental physical hazards to human health. Specifically, the authors describe hazards from air, water, food, hazardous substances, and wastes. To this list the authors have added the additional concerns from climate change, tobacco products, genetically-modified organisms, environment-related diseases, energy production, biodiversity and species endangerment, and the built environment. And as with the first edition, histories of policymaking for specific environmental hazards are portrayed. This edition differs from its antecedent in three significant themes. Global perspectives are added to chapters that describe specific environmental hazards, e.g., air pollution policies in China and India. Also there is the material on the consequences of environmental hazards on both human and ecosystem health. Additionally readers are provided with information about interventions that policymakers and individuals can consider in mitigating or preventing specific environmental hazards. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Book","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85054408935",NA,NA

In soil, N2O is produced through the process of incomplete microbial denitrification or as a by-product of nitrification. Agricultural soils are the main source of N2O emissions globally. Total N2O emissions from dairy grazed farm systems can be dominated by large emissions within a small area (hotspots). Typically, N2O hotspots are areas with high stocking density, high excretal inputs (resulting in high soil N), and situations when soil water filled pore space is elevated. Different pasture grazing systems can be used on dairy farms, including year-round low input dairy systems and higher input systems with some animal confinement component. Potential N2O hotspot areas can be categorized into the following: areas of manure accumulation, storage, and spreading; areas of high stocking intensity leading to soil compaction and high inputs of urine and dung; cultivation and grazing of forage crops; and landscape features including topography, riparian areas, and soil property effects. High input systems can lead to a greater potential for N2O emission hotspots. To demonstrate the effect of hotspot zones on the calculation of total farm N2O emissions, a model was developed and used to assess the N2O emissions from a New Zealand case-study farm. Emission factor (EF3) values for cow urine in the gateway and water-trough areas were measured on the case-study farm and were both found to be about five times that of the rest of the paddock. Using these values for the total farm emissions calculation, it was found that gateways could be significant hotspots for N2O emission with 3.2% of the farm area contributing 9.4% of the total farm N2O emissions. Knowledge of the significance of hotspot zones would enable more accurate calculation of total farm emissions and more efficient targeting of N2O mitigation strategies. There is a paucity of studies which specifically examine hotspots of N2O emissions from farm-scale features and the full magnitude of the emissions from possible hotspot areas and their contributions to the total farm emissions require further investigation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Dairy farm systems; Emission factors; Grazed pastoral systems; Greenhouse gases; Intensive dairy farms; N2O hotspots; Nitrous oxide; Soil emissions","","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85021179252",NA,NA

From a technical point of view, a large fraction of industrial chemicals and materials from fossil resources can be replaced by their bio-based counterparts. Nevertheless, fossil-based chemistry is still dominant because of optimized production processes and lower costs. The best approach to maximize the valorization of biomass is the processing of biological feedstocks in integrated biorefineries where both bio-based chemicals and energy carriers can be produced, similar to a traditional petroleum refinery. The challenge is to prove, together with the technical and economic feasibility, an environmental feasibility, in terms of lower impact over the entire production chain. In this review, potential renewable substrates, conversion pathways, and target molecules are carefully investigated with reference to the most recent technological advancements. Potential environmental impacts and benefits over the life cycle of products are also reviewed. While an economic and technical feasibility can be, and sometimes has been already, reached, the same is not true yet for environmental feasibility, where several issues still need to be explored and the risk for burden shift is not negligible. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the opportunities and constraints related to the transition from petroleum to biomass chemistry and to draw a roadmap of the most sustainable technologies and promising biomass value chains, screening in parallel their environmental implications, toward a market implementation of bio-based chemistry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","biomass; environmental feasibility; life cycle assessment (LCA); platform chemicals; technical feasibility","Biomass; Chains; Chemical industry; Chemicals; Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Industrial economics; Investments; Life cycle; Molecules; Sustainable development; Economic feasibilities; Environmental feasibility; Environmental implications; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Platform chemicals; Sustainable technology; technical feasibility; Technological advancement; Industrial chemicals","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85027954631",NA,NA

We review principles of social cognition and decision making that shape and constrain how environmental governance systems adapt. We focus primarily on the interplay between key decision makers in society and legal systems. We argue that adaptive governance must overcome three cooperative dilemmas to facilitate adaptation: (1) encouraging collaborative problem solving, (2) garnering social acceptance and commitment, and (3) cultivating a culture of trust and tolerance for change and uncertainty. However, to do so governance systems must cope with biases in people’s decision making that cloud their judgment and create conflict. These systems must also satisfy people’s fundamental needs for self-determination, fairness, and security, ensuring that changes to environmental governance are perceived as legitimate, trustworthy, and acceptable. We discuss the implications of these principles for common governance solutions (e.g., public participation, enforcement) and conclude with methodological recommendations. We outline how scholars can investigate the social cognitive principles involved in cases of adaptive governance. © 2017 by the author(s).","Adaptive governance; Cognition; Cooperation; Environmental law; Legitimacy; Social decision making","adaptive management; climate change; cognition; decision making; environmental change; environmental legislation; environmental policy; governance approach","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85016752062",NA,NA

The book begins by discussing the nature of preindustrial food crises and the changes that have occurred since the 19th century with the ascent of technical science and the fossil fuel revolution. It explains how these changes improved living standards but that the realization of this improvement was usually dependent on government support for smallholder modernization. The author sets out how the evolution of food security in different regions has been influenced by farm policy choices and how these choices were shaped by local societal characteristics, international relations and changing configurations in metropolitan countries. Separate chapters are devoted to the interaction of this evolution with debates on food security and economic growth and with international economic policies. The final chapters highlight the new challenges for global food security that will arise as traditional sources of biomass production and the more easily extractable reserves of fossil biomass become depleted or can no longer be used. Overall, the book emphasizes the inadequacy of current explanations with regard to these challenges. It explores what is needed to ensure a sustainable future and calls for a rethinking of these issues; a necessary reflection in today’s unstable global political situation. © 2017 Niek Koning.","","","Book","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85025647959",NA,NA

One of these is the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP), which deals with two focal issues. The first focus is the effects of UV radiation on human health, animals, plants, biogeochemistry, air quality, and materials. The second focus is on interactions between UV radiation and global climate change and how these may affect humans and the environment. When considering the effects of climate change, it has become clear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously believed. As a result of this, human health and environmental issues will be longer-lasting and more regionally variable. Like the other Panels, the EEAP produces a detailed report every four years; the most recent was published as a series of seven papers in 2015 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2015, 14, 1-184). In the years in between, the EEAP produces less detailed and shorter Progress Reports of the relevant scientific findings. The most recent of these was for 2015 (Photochem. Photobiol.

This fund is managed at sub-regional level by the Community-Led Local Development approach that involves Local Action Groups in order to promote the objectives of Rural Sustainable Development within rural municipalities. Each Local Action Group applies the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis in order to identify for its own rural municipalities the strategic elements to which it will allocate the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development budget. Nevertheless, this analysis has some general shortcomings, including difficulties in managing a large number of Strength and Weakness factors. In addition, the importance of each factor cannot be measured quantitatively, and the same factor may be characterized both as a Strength and a Weakness. Further difficulties may occur in the case of partnerships between different Local Action Groups, such as disagreement about whether a given factor is a Strength or a Weakness, lack of information about the relationships between Strength and a Weakness factors and decision alternatives, as well as impossibility of ranking the decision alternatives. Thus, this research aims to overcome the drawbacks of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis and to support Local Action Group partnerships in the sustainability evaluation of their rural municipalities, and therefore to aid the identification of a common Rural Sustainable Development strategy to allocate the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development budget. This decision problem was tackled by applying a Multiple Criteria Spatial Decision Support System that integrates a Geographic Information System with the Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding methods “Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution” and “Dominance-based Rough Set Approach”. In order to demonstrate the validity of this methodological approach, this Multiple Criteria Spatial Decision Support System was applied to a study area of thirteen rural municipalities located in Apulia Region (Southern Italy); these municipalities belong to the same landscape unit, but they are managed by five different policy makers that represent the Local Action Groups. The results provided the maps of environmental, economic and social sustainability rankings of rural municipalities as well as their overall sustainability value. Based on these rankings, a specific Rural Sustainable Development strategy was identified for the allocation of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. This methodology provided a common decision making framework that can also be applied to Local Action Group partnerships within the European Union. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","DRSA; Local Action Groups; Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding; Rural Sustainable Development; Spatial Decision Support Systems; TOPSIS","decision support system; European Union; GIS; local participation; multicriteria analysis; planning method; rural planning; spatial analysis; sustainable development; territorial planning; Italy; Puglia","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84983792822",NA,NA

Whilst the climate change mitigation is perhaps the primary driver behind the promotion of biofuels, climate change is not the only crucial impact associated with biofuel production and consumption systems. This study aims at analysing the extent of the dominant focus on climate impacts in Swedish research applying environmental systems analysis (ESA) tools to investigate the environmental impacts of biofuels, and why this may exist. A systematic literature review of Swedish research applying ESA tools in the study of transportation biofuels between 2000 and 2015 was conducted; identifying 64 studies. The results indicate that studies using life cycle assessment include a range of impact categories in addition to climate impacts, e.g. acidification and eutrophication. However, when also considering environmental footprints (i.e., carbon and water footprints) and material flow analyses, the dominance of carbon footprints leads to an overly dominant focus on climate impacts at the expense of other impact categories. The consideration of environmental impacts other than those related to climate impacts is discussed in terms of the influence of the dominant science-policy framework in Sweden and study dependent variables, such as data uncertainty and methodological limitations. Whilst biofuel production is inextricably linked to climate policy, the environmental impacts of Swedish biofuel production and consumption should also consider the broader context of the Swedish National Environmental Objectives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Analysis; Biofuels; Carbon footprint; Environmental systems; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Sweden","Biofuels; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Eutrophication; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Analysis; Climate change mitigation; Environmental objectives; Environmental systems; Environmental systems analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Sweden; Systematic literature review; Environmental impact","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84991627427",NA,NA

However, limited information is currently available on their occurrence and associated potential risks in GVP systems. The present study documents the occurrence and composition of 15 PAEs in soil, plastic film, and vegetable samples from eight large-scale GVP bases in Beijing, China. Results showed that PAEs are ubiquitous contaminants in these GVP bases. Total PAE concentrations ranged from 0.14 to 2.13 mg/kg (mean 0.99 mg/kg) in soils and from 0.15 to 6.94 mg/kg (mean 1.49 mg/kg) in vegetables. Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, and diisobutyl phthalate were the most abundant components, which accounted for > 90% of the total PAEs. This investigation also indicated that the widespread application of plastic film in GVP systems may be the primary source of these PAEs. The non-cancer and carcinogenic risks of target PAEs were estimated based on the exposures of vegetable intake. The hazard quotients of PAE in all vegetable samples were lower than 1 and the carcinogenic risks were also at acceptable levels for consumers. The data in this study can provide valuable information to understand the status of potential pollutants, specifically PAEs, in GVP systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse vegetable production; Phthalate esters; Plastic film; Risk assessment","Greenhouses; Plastic films; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Soils; Vegetables; Carcinogenic risk; Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate; Di-n-butyl phthalate; Greenhouse vegetables; Hazard quotients; Limited information; Phthalate ester; Vegetable samples; Esters; bis(2 methoxyethyl)phthalate; bis(2 n butoxyethyl)phthalate; bis(4 methyl 2 pentyl)phthalate; di n hexyl phthalate; di(2 ethoxyethyl)phthalate; diamyl phthalate; dicyclohexyl phthalate; diisobutyl phthalate; dipentyl phthalate; phthalic acid benzyl butyl ester; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; phthalic acid diethyl ester; phthalic acid dimethyl ester; phthalic acid dioctyl ester; phthalic acid ester; plastic; plastic film; unclassified drug; ester; phthalic acid derivative; carcinogen; concentration (composition); crop production; phthalate; plastic; pollutant source; risk assessment; vegetable; Article; China; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; food intake; greenhouse; greenhouse vegetable production; health hazard; nonhuman; priority journal; risk assessment; soil; vegetable; vegetable breeding; agriculture; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; food contamination; risk assessment; soil pollutant; vegetable; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Agriculture; Beijing; Environmental Monitoring; Esters; Food Contamination; Phthalic Acids; Risk Assessment; Soil Pollutants; Vegetables","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84989851990",NA,NA

An interesting application, printed circuit board substrates based on biobased materials, has recently been proposed, produced, and tested by several researchers. Building on these exploratory studies, this paper aims to evaluate and compare the environmental impact of biobased and conventional printed circuit board substrates. The conventional materials for printed circuit board substrates are epoxy resin reinforced by woven glass fibre fabric. Recent studies demonstrate that epoxidized linseed oil reinforced by flax fibre can meet most of the requirements specified in standards for printed circuit board substrates. A functional unit of 1 m2 of a printed circuit board substrate was selected for the comparative cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment, and incineration with energy recovery has been considered as an end-of-life scenario. The comparative life cycle assessment documented in this paper shows that a biobased printed circuit board substrate offers a clear impact reduction compared to the conventional design for most impact categories, except for freshwater toxicity, eutrophication, and land use. These are well-known problems for agro-products with pesticide and fertilizer use in cultivation. The environmental impact caused in the End-of-Life stage is generally negligible compared to the production stage for both types of printed circuit board substrates. However, the biobased substrate has a higher embodied energy compared to the conventional substrate, and consequently enables lowering of the fuel use for incineration or providing a higher energy output in the case of a combustion scenario. It can be concluded that the biobased design, composed of flax-fibre reinforced epoxidized linseed oil, is characterized by a lower overall environmental impact. The aggregated weighted eco-points score obtained using the ReCiPe methodology is 42% lower than for the conventional design for the chosen functional unit and scenario. Because the extensively measured technical properties of the biobased substrate were found to comply with almost all international standard specifications, the biobased design offers promising perspectives for further study. However, for industrial application, the major weaknesses of biobased materials, such as the high water absorbance, must be addressed. In addition, the higher land use raises considerable concern, indicating conflicts over food cultivation for use of biobased materials for manufacturing purposes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Composite; Epoxidized linseed oil; Flax fibre; Life cycle assessment; Printed circuit board substrate; Woven glass fibre fabric","Composite materials; Driers (materials); Drying oils; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Epoxy resins; Eutrophication; Fiber reinforced materials; Fibers; Flax; Glass; Glass fibers; Incineration; Land use; Life cycle; Linen; Oils and fats; Oilseeds; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuit design; Reconfigurable hardware; Reinforcement; Weaving; Yarn; Comparative life cycle assessment; Conventional materials; Electronic application; Epoxidized linseed oil; Flax fibres; International standards; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Woven glass; Substrates","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84988864404",NA,NA

This article presents the concept of externalities and makes a case for its usefulness, noting reasons why environmental sociologists should like it and use it more than they do currently. The concept is closely tied to theories–of why environmental problems occur and how they can be addressed–which contradict influential perspectives in environmental sociology. But an externalities-centred approach to environmental issues is nonetheless highly sociological and consistent with current research in other subfields. From an externalities perspective, environmental problems and protection are intrinsically social, and often highly political, rooted in relations of injustice and/or distrust. Practically, the most promising solutions to environmental problems embody a balance of market liberalism and strong state regulation. Externalities should therefore be a constructively unifying concept for environmental research across the social sciences.

These contaminants have been observed in several environmental compartments and matrices, and they may cause severe adverse efects in humans and ecosystems. In this study more than 240 papers investigating the analytical developments regarding the analysis on ED in environmental matrices and the occurrence of these compounds were critically evaluated. Modern sample preparation procedures aiming the use of minimal sample manipulation, minimal amount of solvents and energy according to the Green Chemistry principles are widely used. The ED in marine environments occurs in trace concentrations and their quantification still represents a challenge. The efects of these contaminants in marine ecosystems are poorly understood. However, due to their large use, it is predicted that new analytical developments to deal with ED contamination will promote a large increase in the number of scientific publications in the near future. Regulations and mitigation measures for the presence of these contaminants in the environment are still scarce and need to be quickly implemented to reduce potential future adverse efects on ecosystem services of coastal environments.","Contamination; Emerging contaminants; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental analysis; Sample preparation","","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84991510821",NA,NA

Sensitivity analyses are a routine part of LCA but often used with a narrow focus. In a case study on foodstuff packaging, the environmental performance of two food cartons in comparison with competing packaging solutions, i.e. food cartons, glass jars, steel cans, plastic pots and retortable pouches, was examined. Furthermore, the benefits of additional sensitivity analyses as a tool to model country-specific conditions to extend the applicability of LCA findings across a number of systems were evaluated. Methods: A cradle-to-grave LCA in compliance with ISO standards 14040 and 14044 for the European market (EU27 + 2) was performed. The study was accompanied by a critical review process. The choice of the analysed packaging systems was made according to the European market share. Relevant processes were modelled with primary input data wherever possible; otherwise, average data from public LCI databases were applied. A wide range of environmental impact categories were covered: Climate Change, Ozone Depletion Potential, Summer Smog, Acidification, Eutrophication, Human Toxicity: PM10 and Abiotic Resource Depletion. To comply with ISO standards, a sensitivity analysis on allocation was performed. In addition, sensitivity analyses on recycling rates were included. Results and discussion: The primary environmental impacts for both food cartons arose from base material production for primary packaging. The environmental performance of the food cartons compared favourably with all competing systems for virtually all examined impact categories, primarily due to the fact that primary packaging materials for food cartons are derived from renewable resources. The additional sensitivity analyses quantifying the influence of end-of-life management did not change overall results yet revealed trajectories that could be indicative of trends in a range of different settings from no to complete recycling. Thus, the additional sensitivity analyses revealed a robust result that may be informative in circumstances that depart from European settings. Conclusions: Both food cartons show a superior performance in comparison with alternatives. The sensitivity analyses on recycling rates confirm this result even with very low or high quotas applied. These analyses provide valuable information on how different parameters depending on different geographic scopes may influence the overall results. Future LCA work would benefit from low-effort additional sensitivity analyses to broaden applicability of results and examine the robustness of findings. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","End-of-life; Environmental impacts; LCA; Liquid carton; Packaging; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis","abiotic resource depletion; acidification; Article; climate change; combibloc carton; combisafe carton; comparative study; controlled study; end of life management; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; European; eutrophication; food packaging; life cycle assessment; ozone depletion potential; packaging material; particulate matter; priority journal; product parameters; recycling; sensitivity analysis; smog","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84962208473",NA,NA

However, knowledge of the sustainability of plastic mulching remains vague in terms of both an environmental and agronomic perspective. This review critically discusses the current understanding of the environmental impact of plastic mulch use by linking knowledge of agricultural benefits and research on the life cycle of plastic mulches with direct and indirect implications for long-term soil quality and ecosystem services. Adverse effects may arise from plastic additives, enhanced pesticide runoff and plastic residues likely to fragment into microplastics but remaining chemically intact and accumulating in soil where they can successively sorb agrochemicals. The quantification of microplastics in soil remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate analytical techniques. The cost and effort of recovering and recycling used mulching films may offset the aforementioned benefits in the long term. However, comparative and long-term agronomic assessments have not yet been conducted. Furthermore, plastic mulches have the potential to alter soil quality by shifting the edaphic biocoenosis (e.g. towards mycotoxigenic fungi), accelerate C/N metabolism eventually depleting soil organic matter stocks, increase soil water repellency and favour the release of greenhouse gases. A substantial process understanding of the interactions between the soil microclimate, water supply and biological activity under plastic mulches is still lacking but required to estimate potential risks for long-term soil quality. Currently, farmers mostly base their decision to apply plastic mulches rather on expected short-term benefits than on the consideration of long-term consequences. Future interdisciplinary research should therefore gain a deeper understanding of the incentives for farmers and public perception from both a psychological and economic perspective in order to develop new support strategies for the transition into a more environment-friendly food production. © 2016 .","Biodegradation; Ecological transformation; Ecosystem services; Microplastics; Plasticulture; Soil organic matter dynamics","Additives; Agricultural chemicals; Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Bioactivity; Biodegradation; Biogeochemistry; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Microplastic; Organic compounds; Risk perception; Soil moisture; Soil quality; Sustainable development; Water supply; Ecological transformation; Ecosystem services; Microplastics; Plasticulture; Soil organic matter dynamics; Biodegradable polymers; metal; organic matter; pesticide; phthalic acid; plastic; polyethylene; plastic; soil; soil pollutant; agricultural application; biodegradation; ecosystem service; environmental impact assessment; mulching; plastic; soil degradation; soil organic matter; strategic approach; agriculture; agroecosystem; agronomic benefit; awareness; biodegradation; carbon metabolism; cost benefit analysis; environmental parameters; greenhouse gas; landscape; life cycle; nitrogen metabolism; organism community; plastic mulching; priority journal; Review; soil degradation; soil moisture; soil porosity; soil property; soil quality; soil stability; water transport; agriculture; analysis; chemistry; ecosystem; environment; procedures; soil; soil pollutant; Fungi; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Environment; Pesticides; Plastics; Soil; Soil Pollutants","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84957590381",NA,NA

Shunde channel as an important drinking water sources of Foshan City, Guangdong province, was studied as a case, of which the classification evaluation system was set up. In detail, several evaluation factors were selected according to the local conditions of nature, society and economy, including the pollution degree of heavy metals in soil and sediment, soil characteristics, groundwater sensitivity, vegetation coverage, the type and location of pollution sources. Data information was mainly obtained by means of field survey, sampling analysis, and remote sensing interpretation. Afterwards, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was adopted to decide the weight of each factor. The basic spatial data layers were set up respectively and overlaid based on the weighted summation assessment model in Geographical Information System (GIS), resulting in a classification map of soil environmental protection level in priority area of Shunde channel. Accordingly, the area was classified to three levels named as polluted zone, risky zone and safe zone, which respectively accounted for 6.37%, 60.90% and 32.73% of the whole study area. Polluted zone and risky zone were mainly distributed in Lecong, Longjiang and Leliu towns, with pollutants mainly resulted from the long-term development of aquaculture and the industries containing furniture, plastic constructional materials and textile and clothing. In accordance with the main pollution sources of soil, targeted and differentiated strategies were put forward.

The bivalve Mytilus edulis is an important contributor to this service, and is used in managing eutrophic waters. Studies show that they are affected by changes in pH due to ocean acidification, reducing their growth. This is forecasted to lead to reductions in M. edulis biomass of up to 50% by 2100. Growth reduction will negatively affect the filtering capacity of each individual, potentially leading to a decrease in bioremediation of waste.

A model, based on the interrelationships of economic, demographic, housing structure and waste management policy variables influencing the rate of solid waste generation and recycling is developed and employed. The empirical analysis is based on the information derived from a field questionnaire survey conducted in Prespa Park villages for the year 2014. Another feature of this study is to test whether a household's waste generation can be decoupled from its population growth. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlation analysis and F-tests are used to know the relationship between variables. One-way and two-way fixed effects models data analysis techniques are used to identify variables that determine the effectiveness of waste generation and recycling at household level in the study area. The results reveal that households with heterogeneous characteristics, such as education level, mean building age and income, present different challenges of waste reduction goals. Numerically, an increase of 1% in education level of population corresponds to a waste reduction of 3. kg on the annual per capita basis. A village with older buildings, in the case of one year older of the median building age, corresponds to a waste generation increase of 12. kg. Other economic and policy incentives such as the mean household income, pay-as-you-throw, percentage of population with access to curbside recycling, the number of drop-off recycling facilities available per 1000 persons and cumulative expenditures on recycling education per capita are also found to be effective measures in waste reduction. The mean expenditure for recycling education spent on a person for years 2010 and 2014 is 12 and 14 cents, respectively and it vary from 0 to €1. For years 2010 and 2014, the mean percentage of population with access to curbside recycling services is 38.6% and 40.3%, and the mean number of drop-off recycling centers per 1000 persons in the population is 0.29 and 0.32, respectively. Empirical evidence suggests that population growth did not necessarily result in increases in waste generation. The results provided are useful when planning, changing or implementing sustainable municipal solid waste management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Drop-off recycling facilities; Housing structure; Pay-as-you-throw; Prespa Park; Recycling education expenditure; Recycling rate; Solid waste","Drops; Economic and social effects; Education; Housing; Population statistics; Recycling; Rural areas; Solid wastes; Surveys; Waste management; Bivariate correlations; Data analysis techniques; Descriptive statistics; Heterogeneous characteristic; Pay-as-you-throw; Recycling facilities; Recycling rate; Waste management policy; Municipal solid waste; domestic waste; empirical analysis; national park; questionnaire survey; recycling; solid waste; waste facility; waste management; age; analysis; building; case study; controlled study; cost; demography; domestic waste; economics; education; empirical analysis; income; municipal solid waste; policy; population growth; priority journal; questionnaire; recycling; Review; solid waste; solid waste generation; solid waste management; waste management; Albania; family size; Greece; housing; human; procedures; recycling; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; waste disposal; solid waste; Albania; Family Characteristics; Greece; Housing; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Population Growth; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84952981079",NA,NA

Analysis of results revealed that mean monthly WTPs increase, although not linearly, in the least urbanized areas (~0.73 USD), the urbanized areas (~1.96 USD), and the most urbanized areas (~1.65 USD). Common factors that influenced WTP were (a) higher level education and (b) a habit of separating recyclables.

As a result, the environmental problems and negative impacts of agricultural waste are drawn more and more attention. Therefore, there is a need to adopt proper approaches to reduce and reuse agricultural waste. This review presented about 200 literatures published in 2015 relating to the topic of agricultural waste. The review examined research on agricultural waste in 2015 from the following four aspects: the characterization, reuse, treatment, and management. Researchers highlighted the importance to reuse agricultural waste and investigated the potential to utilize it as biofertilizers, cultivation material, soil amendments, adsorbent, material, energy recycling, enzyme and catalyst etc. The treatment of agricultural waste included carbonization, biodegradation, composting hydrolysis and pyrolysis. Moreover, this review analyzed the differences of the research progress in 2015 from 2014. It may help to reveal the new findings and new trends in this field in 2015 comparing to 2014.

It is predicted that at least two thirds of the world's citizens will reside in towns and cities by the middle of this century, up from one third in the middle of the previous century. Not only is it essential to provide space for work and dwelling, but also for their well-being. Well-being is inextricably linked with the surrounding environment, and natural landscapes have a potent positive effect. For this reason, the inclusion and management of urban green infrastructure has become a topic of increasing scientific interest. Elements of this infrastructure, including green roofs and façades are of growing importance to operators in each stage of the planning, design and construction process in urban areas. Currently, there is a strong recognition that ""green is good"". Despite the positive recognition of urban greenery, and the concerted efforts to include more of it in cities, greater scientific attention is needed to better understand its role in the urban environment. For example, many solutions are cleverly engineered without giving sufficient consideration to the biology of the vegetation that is used. This review contends that whilst ""green is good"" is a positive mantra to promote the inclusion of urban greenery, there is a significant opportunity to increase the contribution of plant science to the process of urban planning through both green infrastructure, and biomimicry. © 2016 by the authors.","Architecture; Biomimicry; Future cities; Plants; Urban planning","","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85007504939",NA,NA

Due to this fundamental role, its use is increasingly widespread including emerging or underdeveloped countries. The global amount of packaging materials manufactured and disposed of every day has led many researchers to deal with the issue of their environmental impact. Several studies have been performed starting from 1990 to the present that have been aimed at demonstrating the best type of use of and end of life for each type of food-packaging material. In recent years, some studies have also demonstrated how the extension of the food shelf life by means of improved packaging could decrease the environmental impact of an entire packaged food based mainly on the reduction of the associated food waste. Based on these premises, this chapter aims at reviewing the main articles in the field of environmental assessment of food packaging by means of a life-cycle assessment approach and showing how, during the last two decades, this issue has received increasing attention. The review was performed by analysing 172 scientific papers collected from the Scopus database using specific keywords and refining the results based on a detailed analysis of the content of each article. The results show how interest in this topic has grown consistently during the last 25 years and indicates several research lines available for further studies in this field. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.","Environmental impact; Food packaging; Food waste; LCA; Packaging systems; Review","","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85047069177",NA,NA

Life cycle assessment methodology has also been applied to economies, trade between countries, aspects of production, and waste management, including CO2 capture and sequestration. Life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions are often part of wider environmental assessments, which also cover other environmental impacts. Such wider-ranging assessments allow for considering “trade-offs” between (reduction of) greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts and co-benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Databases exist which contain estimates of current greenhouse gas emissions linked to fossil fuel use and to many current agricultural and industrial activities. However, these databases do allow for substantial uncertainties in emission estimates. Assessments of greenhouse gas emissions linked to new processes and products are subject to even greater data-linked uncertainty. Variability in outcomes of life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions may furthermore originate in different choices regarding functional units, system boundaries, time horizons, and the allocation of greenhouse gas emissions to outputs in multi-output processes. Life cycle assessments may be useful in the identification of life cycle stages that are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and of major reduction options, in the verification of alleged climate benefits, and to establish major differences between competing products. They may also be helpful in the analysis and development of options, policies, and innovations aimed at mitigation of climate change. The main findings from available life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions are summarized, offering guidance in mitigating climate change. Future directions in developing life cycle assessment and its application are indicated. These include better handling of indirect effects, of uncertainty, and of changes in carbon stock of recent biogenic origin and improved comprehensiveness in dealing with climate warming. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","","Climate change; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Uncertainty analysis; Waste disposal; Environmental assessment; Indirect effects; Industrial activities; ITS applications; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle stages; Multi-output process; Resource extraction; Life cycle","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85024918690",NA,NA

In contrast to ahistorical systems, which are governed solely by constraints (i.e. laws), historical systems and their dynamics can be understood only if properly described, in the course of time. Describing these dynamics and understanding long-term variability can be seen as the mission of long time series measuring not only simple abiotic features but also complex biological variables, such as species diversity and abundances, allowing deep insights in the functioning of food webs and ecosystems in general. Long time-series are irreplaceable for understanding change, and crucially inherent system variability and thus envisaging future scenarios. This notwithstanding current policies in funding and evaluating scientific research discourage the maintenance of long term series, despite a clear need for long-term strategies to cope with climate change. Time series are crucial for a pursuit of the much invoked Ecosystem Approach and to the passage from simple monitoring programs of large-scale and long-term Earth observatories - thus promoting a better understanding of the causes and effects of change in ecosystems. The few ongoing long time series in European waters must be integrated and networked so as to facilitate the formation of nodes of a series of observatories which, together, should allow the long-term management of the features and characteristics of European waters. Human capacity building in this region of expertise and a stronger societal involvement are also urgently needed, since the expertise in recognizing and describing species and therefore recording them reliably in the context of time series is rapidly vanishing from the European Scientific community. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Citizen science; Long-term data; Taxonomy","abundance; biodiversity; climate change; food web; species diversity; taxonomy; time series; Europe","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84949627850",NA,NA

Despite the challenges of counting and making commensurable the global warming impact of a myriad of biophysical and societal activities, this desire to communicate a product or service's carbon footprint has sparked complicated carbon calculative practices and enrolled actors at literally every node of multi-scaled and vastly complex global supply chains. Against this landscape, this paper critically analyzes the counting practices that create the 'e' in 'CO2e'. It is shown that, central to these practices are a series of tools, models and databases which, in building upon previous work (Eden, 2012; Star and Griesemer, 1989) we conceptualize here as 'boundary objects'. By enrolling everyday actors from farmers to consumers, these objects abstract and stabilize greenhouse gas emissions from their messy material and social contexts into units of CO2e which can then be translated along a product's supply chain, thereby establishing a new currency of 'everyday supply chain carbon'. However, in making all greenhouse gas-related practices commensurable and in enrolling and stabilizing the transfer of information between multiple actors these objects oversee a process of simplification reliant upon, and subject to, a multiplicity of approximations, assumptions, errors, discrepancies and/or omissions. Further the outcomes of these tools are subject to the politicized and commercial agendas of the worlds they attempt to link, with each boundary actor inscribing different meanings to a product's carbon footprint in accordance with their specific subjectivities, commercial desires and epistemic framings. It is therefore shown that how a boundary object transforms greenhouse gas emissions into units of CO2e, is the outcome of distinct ideologies regarding 'what' a product's carbon footprint is and how it should be made legible. These politicized decisions, in turn, inform specific reduction activities and ultimately advance distinct, specific and increasingly durable transition pathways to a low carbon society. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting; Boundary object; Carbon; Climate change; CO2e; Measurement","Agenda 21; atmospheric modeling; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; consumer-resource interaction; emissions trading; global warming; greenhouse gas; landscape structure; measurement method; political change; political ideology; stabilization; trade-environment relations; accountability; carbon emission; climate change; database; emission control; environmental politics; human activity; ideology","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84938098597",NA,NA

The promotion of sustainable futures is taking on a new urgency in the context of climate change and biodiversity loss. This concise and accessible text explores how the international community is responding to the challenge of sustainable development. It also investigates the prospect for, and barriers to, the promotion of sustainable development in high-consumption societies of the industrialised world, from the USA and the EU to the economies of transition in Eastern and Southern Asia. In Sustainable Development Baker considers the global impact of China's industrial boom as well as how Chinese investments are shaping the prospects for sustainable development on the African continent. This global coverage is balanced by investigating how local action, ranging from the transition towns movement in the UK to the Green Belt movement in Kenya, can contribute to the pursuit of sustainable development. The second edition has been extensively revised and updated and benefits from the addition of three new chapters: sustainable development in China; the governance of sustainable development; and sustainable production and consumption. Climate change and biodiversity management have also been expanded into full chapters. Providing an up-to-date and comprehensive treatment of the issues surrounding the promotion of sustainable development, this unique, internationally-focused book combines a strong conceptual analysis with wide ranging empirical focus and a wealth of case material. Including summary points and suggestions for further reading, as well as web resources and an extensive bibliography, it is ideal for students, scholars and researchers in the fields of environmental sciences, politics, geography, sociology and development studies. © 2016 Susan Baker.

Understanding root physiological processes in concert with soil microbial N dynamics following spatially discrete N pulses under field conditions will aid in the management of agroecosystem processes for N use efficiency. Methods: This study examined the short-term response (&lt;5 days) of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) roots and soil N cycling to a pulse of inorganic N in an undisturbed soil patch on an organic farm using a novel combination of molecular and 15N isotopic techniques. Results: Tomato roots rapidly responded to and exploited the N pulse via upregulation of key N metabolism genes (e.g. cytosolic glutamine synthetase GS1) that comprise the core physiological response of roots to patchy soil N availability. Strong root activity limited accumulation of soil NO3− despite high rates of gross nitrification. Roots out-competed soil microbes for the inorganic N, even on a short time scale, likely as a result of high plant N demand and microbial C limitation. The transient root gene expression response (absent by 4 days after the N pulse) underscored the sensitivity of root N uptake to local N availability. Conclusions: Root expression of genes such as GS1 could complement soil inorganic N pools and measurements of soil microbial activity to serve as integrative indicators of rapid plant-soil N cycling. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Cytosolic glutamine synthetase; Isotope pool dilution; Nitrogen cycling; Root gene expression; Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum)","agricultural ecosystem; biological uptake; fruit; gene expression; metabolism; nitrogen cycle; nutrient availability; organic farming; root system; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; Lycopersicon esculentum","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84929960614",NA,NA

This study proposes a porous model that couples the interfacial area ratio (IAR) equation for the diffusion of nitrogen with mass transport equation in porous medium (soil). The model presents the release of a single granule with an imperfect coating thickness in different environments. The model is validated with experiments in water and soil environments. In addition, it is compared to our previous model and shows an enhancement in its predictive ability because the imperfection of the coating layer has been integrated in the model. On the basis of the proposed model, the influence of coating variation and soil types also are investigated. In general, simulation results suggest that the coating layer imperfection leads to earlier and faster nitrogen release than an ideal one. Also, nitrogen release in soil depends on soil characteristics such as surface area, particle size, and density. The comparison with experimental observations taken from the literature has validated the model's prediction of nitrogen release in different soil types. Finally, the model has an advantage that it can model the nitrogen release either in water or soil environments. By using the input from the experimental data for the release in water, the release in soil is extrapolated based on the specific soil properties, which can be obtained from experiments or the literature. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","","Coatings; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Particle size; Porous materials; Thickness measurement; Urea; Coating thickness; Controlled-release fertilizers; Interfacial areas; Mass transport equation; Nitrogen release; Predictive abilities; Soil characteristics; Soil environment; Soils","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84936131768",NA,NA

Variability in soil organic matter and management of organic farms across an agricultural landscape may yield insights for improving N cycling and for evaluating novel indicators of N availability. We assessed yields, plant-soil N cycling, and root expression of N metabolism genes across a representative set of organic fields growing Roma-type tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) in an intensively-managed agricultural landscape in California, USA. The fields spanned a three-fold range of soil carbon (C) and N but had similar soil types, texture, and pH. Organic tomato yields ranged from 22.9 to 120.1 Mg ha-1 with a mean similar to the county average (86.1 Mg ha-1), which included mostly conventionallygrown tomatoes. Substantial variability in soil inorganic N concentrations, tomato N, and root gene expression indicated a range of possible tradeoffs between yields and potential for N losses across the fields. Fields showing evidence of tightly-coupled plant-soil N cycling, a desirable scenario in which high crop yields are supported by adequate N availability but low potential for N loss, had the highest total and labile soil C and N and received organic matter inputs with a range of N availability. In these fields, elevated expression of a key gene involved in root N assimilation, cytosolic glutamine synthetase GS1, confirmed that plant N assimilation was high even when inorganic N pools were low. Thus tightlycoupled N cycling occurred on several working organic farms. Novel combinations of N cycling indicators (i.e. inorganic N along with soil microbial activity and root gene expression for N assimilation) would support adaptive management for improved N cycling on organic as well as conventional farms, especially when plant-soil N cycling is rapid. © 2015, Public Library of Science.

The GPI is an aggregate index of over 20 economic, social and environmental indicators, and accounts for both the welfare benefits of economic growth, and the social and environmental costs which accompany that economic growth. The result is better information about the level of welfare or well-being of a country's population. This book measures the GPI of Hong Kong and Singapore from 1968 to 2010. It finds that for both countries, economic output (as measured by the GDP) has grown more than welfare (as measured by the GPI), but important differences are also found. In Hong Kong, the GPI has grown for the whole period under consideration, while in Singapore the GPI has stalled from 1993. This is in line with most countries and is explained by the ""threshold hypothesis"" which states that beyond a certain level of economic development the benefits of further economic growth are outweighed by even higher environmental and social costs. The book argues that the growth of Hong Kong's GPI is due to its favourable relationship with China and in particular its ability to export low-wage jobs and polluting industries, rather than successful domestic policies. A stalling or shrinking GPI calls for alternative policies than the growth economy promoted by neoclassical economists, and the book explores an alternative model, that of the Steady State Economy (SSE). © 2015 Claudio O.

Wood, charcoal and dung supply over 70% of household energy in SSA, but with improvements in energy technologies, crop-residues and human excreta could also contribute. Improving cookstoves is not enough to make woodfuel use sustainable, reducing deforestation due to woodfuel demand by only 41-50%. Further reductions of 21% are achieved by using crop-residues and 23% by anaerobic digestion of cattle manure. Taken together, these measures could reduce deforestation due to woodfuel demand by 70-100%. Burning crop-residues loses a large proportion of nitrogen needed for crop production, which could be partially counteracted by applying biochar from pyrolysis cookstoves to improve retention of soil nitrogen. Better nutrient recycling would be achieved by composting, but this precludes energy provision. Both energy and efficient nutrient recycling are provided by anaerobic digestion, but carbon sequestration is reduced compared to composting or pyrolysis. Nevertheless, a wider range of waste materials may be recycled in the closed digester system, so pyrolysis of dry crop-residues together with anaerobic digestion of wet wastes is likely to provide the best solution for both food and energy. However, anaerobic digestion may demand more water than pyrolysis and, if soil carbon is reduced, may also increase the need for irrigation. Therefore, in water limited areas, biogas digesters should only be installed if integrated with water harvesting systems. Governments can encourage adoption of sustainable technologies by providing subsidies to cover fixed costs, facilitating credit and complementary infrastructure investments, and improving standardisation and quality control in cookstove and digester markets. Implementation work should involve communities and households, giving women a role in decision-making to ensure community investment in water access. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The challenge is that the topic of sustainability can seem overwhelming and there is limited information that is specific to the food industry. Written by an experienced food industry professional with years of experience in sustainability, The 10 Principles of Food Industry Sustainability inspires and informs the progress required to nourish the population, revitalize natural resources, enhance economic development, and close resource loops. The book makes this complex topic approachable and actionable by identifying the most pressing sustainability priorities across the entire food supply chain and showing, with tools and examples, how producers, processors, packers, distributors, marketers and retailers all play a role in advancing improvement. The book begins with an overview of the Principles of sustainability in the food industry: what they are and why they matter. Subsequent chapters focus on each of the Ten Principles in detail: how they relate to the food industry, their global relevance (including their environmental, health, and social impacts), and the best practices to achieve the potential of meaningful and positive progress that the Principles offer. Specific examples from industry are presented in order to provide scalable solutions and bring the concepts to life, along with top resources for further exploration. The Principles, practices, and potential of sustainability in the food industry covered in this book are designed to be motivating and to offer a much-needed and clear way forward towards a sustainable food supply. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A series of solutions may be implemented in the appropriate management of food waste, and prioritised in a similar way to waste management hierarchy. The most sought-after solutions are represented by avoidance and donation of edible fractions to social services. Food waste is also employed in industrial processes for the production of biofuels or biopolymers. Further steps foresee the recovery of nutrients and fixation of carbon by composting. Final and less desirable options are incineration and landfilling. A considerable amount of research has been carried out on food waste with a view to the recovery of energy or related products.

Centre-ville, Montréal, QC  H3C 3A7, Canada","Soils are one of earth's essential natural resources, supporting nearly all terrestrial life. By and large, current life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methodologies are limited in their assessment of potential land use impacts in terms of terrestrial biodiversity loss. The land use life cycle impact assessment (LULCIA) project spearheaded by the United Nations Environment Programme/Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (UNEP/SETAC) Life Cycle Initiative recently broadened the scope of land use evaluation in life cycle assessment (LCA) by encompassing six additional indicators that represent ecosystem provision and regulation services, as defined in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). Although LCIA methodology is more comprehensive with regards to relevant impact pathways linked to land use, the development could potentially decrease the capacity of LCA as a decision support system by increasing the number of indicators from one to seven for the assessment of the land use impact category alone. To overcome this limitation, the project proposes a new LCIA method to estimate the decrease in value of the ecosystem services provided to society due to land use. The six midpoint land use indicators proposed by the LULCIA project are further modeled into a new area of protection, resources and ecosystem services, based on a functional approach. To do so, indicators expressed in biophysical units are converted into monetary units based on the economic valuation of the reduction of a given ecosystem service. The loss of provision services biotic production and fresh water recharge are estimated through productivity loss and water supply cost, respectively. The regulation services erosion resistance and mechanical and physicochemical water filtration are estimated through the cost of erosion mitigation measures and water purification process costs, respectively. The climate regulation potential is estimated through the social carbon cost: a decrease in carbon sequestration by soils is considered equivalent to an amount of carbon emitted in the atmosphere. We also propose to consider the local socioeconomic context by evaluating the economic adaptation capacity of countries: impacts on the resources and ecosystem services area of protection are only accounted for when the country has the capacity to adapt (while indirect impacts would be calculated by assessing the burdens of the adaptation scenario by performing a full LCA of these adaptation measures). The application of the method is illustrated through a case study evaluating the cradle-to-gate land use impacts of three bio-based polymers (biopolyethylene, polylactic acid and thermoplastic starch) produced in Brazil, Italy, Thailand and the United States. Impact scores are not only influenced by the biophysical specificity of the studied systems (e.g. crop yield affecting the inventory flow, type of biome affecting impact characterisation) but also by the local socioeconomic capacity to compensate for an ecosystem service loss and available compensation measures and technologies. In this case study, thermoplastic starch appears to have fewer impacts on land use and ecosystem services than biopolyethylene or polylactic acid. Overall, the research demonstrates the feasibility of further modeling the biophysical indicators of land use into an economic metric. This additional and complementary modeling step is meant to facilitate the interpretation of LCA results, enabling discussions on the relevance of the biophysical indicators affecting the loss of ecosystem services from land use. It may also be used as an explicit weighting scheme to aggregate the midpoint results into a single value expressing the social cost to compensate for the loss of the ecosystem services. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paradigm shift is an opportunity to implement novel forestry management approaches, such as forested land zoning. Forest zoning consists in separating the land base in three zones that have different management objectives: (1) conservation zones; (2) ecosystem management zones; and (3) intensive production zones, which locally increase productivity, as a trade off to increase the land area dedicated to conservation and ecosystem management. We evaluate the ecological feasibility of implementing forest zoning on a private property (216 ha) at St-Benoît-du-Lac, Québec (Canada) characterised by agricultural and forest land uses. As a basis for delineating conservation and ecosystem management zones, historical and contemporary data and facts on forest composition and dynamics were reviewed, followed by a detailed forest vegetation analysis of forest communities. Delineating intensive production zones was straightforward, as fertile agricultural field margins located downslope were used to establish multifunctional hybrid poplar buffers. At St-Benoît-du-Lac, a realistic zoning scenario would consist of (1) conservation zones covering 25% of the forestland (37 ha); (2) ecosystem management zones covering 75% of the forestland (113 ha, including restoration zones on 24 ha); and (3) intensive production zones on 2.8 ha. Based on a yield projection of 13 t/ha/year for hybrid poplars, only 5.6% of agricultural field areas would need to be converted into agroforestry systems to allow for the loss of wood production in a conservation zone of 37 ha of forest. Ecosystem services provision following the implementation of zoning would include increased habitat quality, biodiversity protection and enhancement (by restoration of some tree species), carbon storage, non-point source aquatic pollution control, local biomass production for heating, and increased forest economic value. © 2015 by the authors.","Agroforestry; Ecosystem services; Enrichment and under planting; Forest conservation and restoration; Forest ecosystem management; Hybrid poplar bioenergy buffer; Juglans; Land use; Priority areas; Quercus","Agriculture; Aquatic ecosystems; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Conservation; Digital storage; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Ecosystems; Land use; Pollution control; Quality control; Restoration; Wood products; Zoning; Agroforestry; Bio-energy; Ecosystem services; Forest conservation; Forest ecosystem management; Juglans; Priority areas; Quercus; Forestry; agricultural land; agroforestry; bioenergy; ecosystem service; forest ecosystem; forest management; land use; nature conservation; paradigm shift; restoration ecology; Agriculture; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land Use; Planting; Quercus; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Juglans; Quercus","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84946430762",NA,NA

From an environmental economics perspective it introduces the difficulties in measuring the economic costs of marine litter; reviews those sectors where these costs are notable; and considers policy instruments, which can reduce these costs. Marine litter is underpinned by dynamic and complex processes, the drivers and impacts of which are multi-scalar, transboundary, and play out in both marine and terrestrial environments. These impacts include economic costs to expenditure, welfare and lost revenue. In most cases, these are not borne by the producers or the polluters. In industries such as fisheries and tourism the costs of marine litter are beginning to be quantified and are considerable. In other areas such as impacts on human health, or more intangible costs related to reduced ecosystem services, more research is evidently needed. As the costs of marine litter are most often used to cover removing debris or recovering from the damage which they have caused, this expenditure represents treatment rather than cure, and although probably cheaper than inaction do not present a strategy for cost reduction. Economic instruments, such as taxes and charges addressing the drivers of waste, for instance those being developed for plastic bags, could be used to reduce the production of marine litter and minimise its impacts. In any case, there remain big gaps in our understanding of the harm caused by marine litter, which presents difficulties when attempting to both quantify its economic costs, and develop effective and efficient instruments to reduce them. © 2015, Springer International Publishing.

The objectives of this study were to identify plant diversity in the plantation understory, quantify the changes in SOC and total nitrogen (TN) storage in deep soil, assess the SOC, TN, and total phosphorus (TP) stoichiometries, and investigate their relationships in the Loess Plateau Region (LPR) undergoing long-term afforestation. Soil samples were collected at a soil depth of 0-200cm under 30-yr old Robinia pseudoacacia L. and adjacent abandoned sites, and SOC, TN and TP were determined in different soil depth. Additionally, plant composition and diversity in the plantation understory were evaluated. The results showed that land subjected to long-term afforestation had greater plant coverage, plant density, richness index (R) and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H) compared to abandoned land communities (P&lt;0.05). SOC, TN and TP contents in afforested sites were significantly increased in surface soil (0-30cm) as well as in the underlying soil (100cm) compared to the corresponding abandoned land sites (P&lt;0.05) in most cases. Meanwhile, SOC, TN, and TP stoichiometry in afforested areas were higher than those of abandoned lands and significantly related to understory vegetation diversity (P&lt;0.05). In addition, lands subjected to long-term afforestation effectively increased SOC and TN storages compared to abandoned land at soil depths of 0-30cm and 100-200cm and were also significantly related to understory vegetation diversity (P&lt;0.05). These findings demonstrating that afforestation not only affects SOC and TN stocks in surface soil, but also strongly influences that in deep soil.

The health evaluation,or diagnoses,of an eco-economy at the small watershed scale requires the integrated analysis of ecological,economic,and social factors,yet few studies have achieved this. The health of an eco-economy comprises three components: vigor,organization,and resilience. We use an analytic hierarchy process to develop a health evaluation index system that evaluates the health of an eco-economy system. We then use this diagnostic method to explore the factors affecting the health status of a semi-arid loess watershed in China in 2007 and 2009. The results show that between 2007 and 2009 the health status of the eco-economy improved from the “better” stage to the “benign circle” stage.

Because they come mainly from the environmental and science disciplines, most environmental professionals have limited training in the fundamentals of economics. This book is designed to provide those professionals not only with the basic principles of economics for foundational purposes but also the economic pros and cons to consider when making critical decisions on environmental issues. Economics for Environmental Professionals provides a fully explanatory, quantitative, and practical introduction to a wide range of topics that make up the science of environmental economics. Moreover, it showcases the power of economic principles to explain and predict issues and current events impacting the environment. It discusses the economics relevant to the environmental mediums of air, water, and land and provides pertinent information on air toxics, hazardous wastes, and other related topics. It provides environmental professionals with the education not only to understand the nuts and bolts of economic analysis but also to conduct economic analyses. Throughout the book, the author joins economics and environmental practice with common-sense approaches and practical real-world examples. Designed to stimulate thought, the book explores strategies for maintaining a safe environment without excessive regulation and cost. With the information in this book, environmental professionals will have an understanding of the framework in which environmental problems exist, what they cost, how to pay for them, and what the payback is (if any). © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Book","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84984884483","selected",NA

Estuaries, the intersection of freshwater and coastal ecosystems, exhibit complex physical and biological processes which must be understood in order to sustain and restore them when necessary. This book demonstrates how, based on an understanding of the processes controlling estuarine ecosystem health, one can quantify its ability to cope with human stresses. The theories, models, and real-world solutions presented serve as a toolkit for designing a management plan for the ecologically sustainable development of estuaries. Provides a sound knowledge of the physical functioning of an estuary, a critical component of understanding its ecological functioning Ideal reference for those interested in marine biology, oceanography, coastal management, and sustainable development Describes the essentials behind conceptual and numerical models of the health of an estuary ecosystem and how to use these models to quantify both human impacts and the value of remediation and management measures Chapters are written in an accessible way that encourages collaboration between aquatic, marine, and wetland biologists, ecologists, oceanographers, geologists, geomorphologists, chemists, and ecosystem modelers Covers the physical, chemical, and biological elements of estuary environments, indicating that the essence of an estuary's functioning lies in its connectivity with the adjacent catchment and the marine/coastal system. © 2016, 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The system boundaries include all management operations undertaken during the following stages: stand establishment, stand tending, cork stripping, and field recovery. The allocation of the environmental impacts to reproduction, second, and virgin cork was based on mass and market price criteria. An alternative allocation approach was simulated by allocating environmental impacts also to the wood produced in the cork oak stands. The impact assessment was performed using the characterization factors recommended by the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD).Results and discussion: In Portugal, cork produced from naturally regenerated stands has a better environmental performance than cork produced from planted stands, but the differences are smaller than 10 %. Different management models of cork oak stands in Portugal and Catalonia (agro-silvopastoral system and forest system, respectively) originate different impact levels, which tend to be significantly lower in Catalonia. The environmental hot spots in the two regions are also distinct. In Catalonia, they are associated with cleaning, road maintenance, and worker and cork transport. In Portugal, they are fertilization, pruning, and cleaning. The two allocation criteria affect significantly the results obtained for virgin cork in Portugal and for virgin and second cork in Catalonia. Besides, when impacts are also allocated to wood, mass allocation should be avoided as it would not create incentives for a sustainable management of cork oak stands.Conclusions: The environmental impact from Catalonian cork may be reduced by decreasing mechanized shrub cleaning and road maintenance operations through the introduction of livestock in cork oak forests, and also by a better planning of management operations. For the Portuguese cork, improvements may be achieved by optimizing fertilizer dosage, planting nitrogen-fixing crops and pastures that improve soil quality, avoiding unnecessary operations, improving the efficiency of management operations, and increasing tree density. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cork; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Quercus suber L; Southern Europe","Article; biomass allocation; cork production; cork tree; environmental impact; industrial production; life cycle assessment; plantation; Portugal; priority journal; wood","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84922071266",NA,NA

It has been predicted that an increase in the pace of sea level rise brought about by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere will cause them to disappear, forcing their inhabitants to migrate. The present book represents a multidisciplinary legal and engineering perspective on this problem, challenging some common misconceptions regarding atolls and their vulnerability to sea-level rise. Coral islands have survived past changes in sea levels, and it is the survival of coral reefs what will be crucial for their continued existence. These islands are important for their inhabitants as they represent not only their ancestral agricultural lands and heritage, but also a source of revenue through the exploitation of the maritime areas associated with them. However, even if faced with extreme climate change, it could theoretically be possible for the richer Atoll Island States to engineer ways to prevent their main islands from disappearing, though sadly not all will have the required financial resources to do so. As islands become progressively uninhabitable their residents will be forced to settle in foreign lands, and could become stateless if the Atoll Island State ceases to be recognized as a sovereign country. However, rather than tackling this problem by entering into lengthy negotiations over new treaties, more practical solutions, encompassing bilateral negotiations or the possibility of acquiring small new territories, should be explored. This would make it possible for Atoll Island States in the future to keep some sort of international sovereign personality, which could benefit the descendents of its present day inhabitants. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

Physico-chemical remediation options are criticized as being costly and not providing environment-friendly solutions. The use of plants and associated microorganisms could be a sustainable, cost-effective option to reduce pollutant exposure. Phytomanagement aims at using valuable non-food crops to alleviate environmental and health risks induced by pollutants, and at restoring ecosystem services. Suitable plant species must be tolerant to contaminants, reduce their transfer into the food chain, and efficiently produce marketable biomass. Based on Miscanthus' capacity to sequestrate inorganic contaminants into the root system and to induce dissipation of persistent organic contaminants in soil, these plant species are favorable for phytostabilization and phytodegradation. Among Miscanthus species, the noninvasive hybrid Miscanthus×. giganteus, with a high lignocellulosic content, is a promising biomass crop for the bio-economy, notably the biorefinery and bioenergy industries. Planting this species on contaminated and marginal land is a promising option to avoid changes in arable land use to mitigate the food vs. biofuel controversy. Key issues in promoting sustainable management of Miscanthus sp. on contaminated land are: (a) crop suitability, integration, and sustainability in a region with a potential local market; (b) site suitability in relation to the species' requirements and potential, (c) biotic interactions in the landscape diversity; and (d) increase in shoot yields in line with various stressors (e.g., pollutants, drought, cold temperatures), and with minimal inputs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass; Miscanthus; Phytodegradation; Phytostabilization; Soil contamination","aluminum; arsenic; biofuel; cellulose; chromium; ground water; hemicellulose; lead; lignin; lignocellulose; zinc; metal; soil pollutant; bioenergy; dissipation; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; energy crop; grass; land use change; literature review; pollutant; pollution exposure; soil pollution; soil remediation; acute toxicity; agriculture; arable land; biodiversity; bioenergy; biofuel production; biomass; biomass conversion; biomass production; building; carbon footprint; combustion; crop production; cultivated species; ecosystem restoration; energy crop; energy yield; food chain; gasification; grassland; green chemistry; human; Miscanthus; nitrate leaching; nonhuman; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; phytotoxicity; plant community; plant growth; plant root; plume; Poaceae; pyrolysis; review; sludge; soil pollution; soil quality; water supply; bioremediation; chimera; crop; ecosystem; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Poaceae; pollution; risk factor; soil pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biofuels; Biomass; Chimera; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollution; Metals; Plant Roots; Poaceae; Risk Factors; Soil Pollutants","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84901670230",NA,NA

To investigate these interactions, we constructed an individual-based model, Mondrian, that integrates individual growth and clonal reproduction, nutrient competitive interactions among species, and ecosystem processes. We conducted in silico experiments, parameterized for Great Lakes coastal marshes, where invaders that differed only in size attempted to invade native communities across a range of N inflows. Small invaders were able to persist only at low N inflow and never dominated. Large invaders were not able to reproduce clonally at low N inflow but they successfully coexisted with natives at intermediate N inflow and dominated at high N inflow, excluding natives in some cases. In both native and invaded communities, a positive feedback in plant-detritus N cycling emerged, amplifying ecosystem N cycling to nearly 2× the range of N inflows. The largest invaders augmented this N-cycling feedback over the native community by up to 23%, increasing with greater N inflow, driving community NPP higher than the native community by 33% and litter mass higher by 35%. In communities dominated by the largest invader, wetland N retention was increased but species diversity decreased. Results demonstrate that a single trait difference, plant size, simultaneously allows natives to resist invasion at low N inflows and allows invaders to dominate at high N inflows, partly through augmenting ecosystem N-cycling feedbacks. © 2014.","Biodiversity; Complexity; Invasive species; Litter; Nutrient cycling; Wetland","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Feedback; Nutrients; Plants (botany); Clonal reproduction; Community composition; Competitive interactions; Complexity; Individual-based modeling; Invasive species; Litter; Nutrient cycling; Wetlands; biological invasion; community composition; complexity; ecosystem modeling; emergence; interspecific interaction; invasive species; litter; nitrogen cycle; nutrient cycling; plant community; recycling; reproduction; size; species diversity; wetland; Great Lakes [North America]","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84897542171",NA,NA

However, the impact on SOC and its fraction stratification is still poorly understood in deep soil in Loess Hilly Region (LHR) of China. Samples were collected from three typical conversion lands, Robinia psendoacacia (RP), Caragana Korshinskii Kom (CK), and abandoned land (AB), which have been converted from slope croplands (SC) for 30 years in LHR. Contents of SOC, total nitrogen (TN), particulate organic carbon (POC), and labile organic carbon (LOC), and their stratification ratios (SR) and carbon management indexes (CMI) were determined on soil profiles from 0 to 200 cm. Results showed that the SOC, TN, POC and LOC stocks of RP were significantly higher than that of SC in soil layers of 0-10, 10-40, 40-100 and 100-200 cm (P<0.05). Soil layer of 100-200 cm accounted for 27.38-36.62%, 25.10-32.91%, 21.59-31.69% and 21.08-26.83% to SOC, TN, POC and LOC stocks in lands of RP, CK and AB. SR values were >2.0 in most cases of RP, CK and AB. Moreover, CMI values of RP, CK, and AB increased by 11.61-61.53% in soil layer of 100-200 cm compared with SC. Significant positive correlations between SOC stocks and CMI or SR values of both surface soil and deep soil layers indicated that they were suitable indicators for soil quality and carbon changes evaluation. The Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) had strong influence on improving quantity and activity of SOC pool through all soil layers of converted lands, and deep soil organic carbon should be considered in C cycle induced by GTGP. It was concluded that converting slope croplands to RP forestlands was the most efficient way for sequestering C in LHR soils. © 2014 Zhao et al.","","carbon; nitrogen; organic carbon; carbon; nitrogen; soil; article; Caragana; China; cropland; loess; nonhuman; Robinia pseudoacacia; soil analysis; soil quality; vegetation; agriculture; chemistry; geography; procedures; regression analysis; soil; Agriculture; Carbon; China; Geography; Nitrogen; Regression Analysis; Soil","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84902670023",NA,NA

Today, the valorization of lignin into the production of chemical feedstocks represents a real challenge in terms of both sustainability and environmental protection. This review first briefly outlines the main points of this challenge and compares the different methods investigated by chemists over the past several decades, pointing out the major difficulties met. Next, the review highlights the recent use of ionic liquids (ILs) as solvents that have provided some new opportunities to efficiently convert lignin and lignin model compounds into value-added aromatic chemicals. Particular focus is given to these new strategies in terms of selectivity, separation and the unique compounds obtained for the oxidation of lignin using ILs. Finally, an assessment of the challenges that must be resolved in order for ILs to become an eco-friendly way of producing chemicals from biomass, including lignin, is proposed. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","Biomass valorization; Green processes; Ionic liquids; Lignin; Oxidation","Biomass valorizations; Cellulose and hemicellulose; Chemical feedstocks; Green process; Innovative strategies; Lignin model compound; Lignocellulosic biomass; Pulp and paper industry; Biomass; Cellulose; Chemicals; Environmental protection; Ionic liquids; Oxidation; Paper and pulp industry; Sustainable development; Lignin; Biomass; Cellulose; Chemicals; Lignins; Oxidation","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84896838114",NA,NA

In waste cathode ray tube (CRT) and fluorescent lamp glass, mercury and lead are present as the major pollutants. The current review discusses the issues related to quantity and associated risk from the pollutant present in HG and proposes the chemical, biological, thermal, hybrid, and nanotechniques for its management. The hybrid is one of the upcoming research models involving the compatible combination of two or more techniques for better and efficient remediation. Thermal mercury desorption starts at 100 °C but for efficient removal, the temperature should be &gt;460 °C. Involvement of solar energy for this purpose makes the research more viable and ecofriendly. Nanoparticles such as Fe, Se, Cu, Ni, Zn, Ag, and WS2 alone or with its formulation can immobilize heavy metals present in HG by involving a redox mechanism. Straight-line equation from year-wise sale can provide future sale data in comparison with lifespan which gives future pollutant approximation. Waste compact fluorescent lamps units projected for the year 2015 is 9,300,000,000 units and can emit nearly 9,300 kg of mercury. On the other hand, CRT monitors have been continuously replaced by more improved versions like liquid crystal display and plasma display panel resulting in the production of more waste.

It is then followed by discussions on critical issues related to sustainable phosphorus management, such as phosphorus-related pollution, the innovation potential of phosphate fertilizers and fertilizer production, uneven geographical distribution of phosphate resources, transparency of reserves, economic scarcity, and price volatility of phosphate products. In order to identify the deficiencies in the world’s phosphorus flows, we utilize the ‘not too little-not too much’ principle (including the Ecological Paracelsus Principle), which is essential to understanding the issues of pollution, supply security, losses, sinks and efficiency of phosphorus use, and the challenges to closing the phosphorus cycle by recycling and other means. When linking the supply-demand (SD) chain view on phosphorus with a Substance or Material Flux Analysis, the key actors in the global phosphorus cycle become evident. It is apparent that sustainable phosphorus management is a very complex issue that requires a global transdisciplinary process to arrive at a consensus solution. This holds true both from an epistemological (i.e., knowledge) perspective as well as from a sustainable management perspective. To gain a complete picture of the current phosphorus cycle, one requires knowledge from a broad spectrum of sciences, ranging from geology, mining, and chemical engineering; soil and plant sciences; and all facets of agricultural and environmental sciences to economics, policy, and behavioral and decision science. As phosphorus flows are bound to specific historical, sociocultural, and geographical issues as well as financial and political interests, the understanding of the complex contextual constraints requires knowledge of related sciences. The need for transdisciplinary processes is equally evident from a sustainable transitioning perspective. In order to identify options, drivers, and barriers to improving phosphorus flows, one requires processes in; capacity building that may be changed and consensus building on the phosphorus use practices that must be changed and maintained, along with recognition of how changes in phosphorus use in the current market may be framed. The latter is illustrated by means of the Global TraPs (Global Transdisciplinary Processes for Sustainable Phosphorus Management) project, a multi-stakeholder initiative including key stakeholders on both sides of the phosphorus SD chain which includes mutual learning between science and society. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Environmental impacts; Food security; Supply-demand chain analysis; Sustainable phosphorus management","","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84948083973",NA,NA

The results showed that compared to the controls, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in all treated groups were elevated significantly after 21 and 28 days exposure; catalase (CAT) activities were much higher in all tests during the entire exposure period; peroxidase (POD) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activities generally decreased and indicated contrary response trend; the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) after exposure to low level of BDE209 (1mgkg-1) was induced, whereas at 10 and 100mgkg-1 concentrations it showed suppression status; electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra suggested that hydroxyl radicals (OH) in earthworms were significantly induced by BDE209; the changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) contents suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) might lead to cellular lipid peroxidation in earthworms. The results of these observations suggested that severe oxidative stress occurred in E. fetida, and it may play an important role in inducing the BDE209 toxicity to earthworms. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidant enzymes; BDE209; Eisenia fetida; Hydroxyl radical; Lipid peroxidation","catalase; decabromodiphenyl ether; flame retardant; glutathione transferase; hydroxyl radical; malonaldehyde; peroxidase; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; biological marker; catalase; decabromobiphenyl ether; diphenyl ether derivative; flame retardant; glutathione transferase; malonaldehyde; peroxidase; reactive oxygen metabolite; soil pollutant; superoxide dismutase; animal experiment; article; concentration response; controlled study; Eisenia fetida; electron spin resonance; enzyme activity; lipid peroxidation; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; risk assessment; animal; drug effects; metabolism; Oligochaeta; soil pollutant; toxicity; Animals; Biological Markers; Catalase; Flame Retardants; Glutathione Transferase; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Malondialdehyde; Oligochaeta; Peroxidase; Reactive Oxygen Species; Risk Assessment; Soil Pollutants; Superoxide Dismutase","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84904106006",NA,NA

Previous research has shown that these tools are frequently applied in isolation at different stages of the project life cycle. The extent of EIA/EMS integration amongst nine of the biggest UK waste management companies was investigated through semi-structured interviews with environmental staff and thematic analysis of their responses. The research found that partial integration of EIA and EMS is widespread. Companies recognised a range of potential benefits to more closely integrating their processes such as system efficiencies, data availability and recognition from the regulator. However, significant barriers to further integration were identified in the form of cost, company structure and the size of the organisation. In a context where the regulation of the waste industry is increasingly aligned towards a risk-based approach, there is a new opportunity to use EIA outputs in an enhanced EMS. More generally, companies should seek to maintain continuity of personnel across the project life cycle and structure their environmental functions so that EIA and EMS staff can work more closely. This would help ensure that the greatest benefit is derived from both tools. © 2014 © 2014 IAIA.","EIA; EIA follow-up; EMS; integration; UK; waste","development project; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental protection; organizational framework; regulatory framework; waste management; United Kingdom","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84894238207",NA,NA

Studies have shown that individuals with certain values or political ideologies are less likely to believe in the existence of scientific consensus about climate change, have positive attitudes toward addressing climate change as an urgent policy matter, and behave in ways that reduce energy use. Connecting climate change to national security risks and reduced fossil fuel use to strengthening the military can affect these individuals' attitudes, beliefs, and behavior in these arenas. In particular, two aspects of the Military-Environmental Complex can serve as potential drivers of change: first, the military's role as an unequivocal validator of climate science, and, second, its current efforts to value the true costs and benefits to its mission of energy conservation and increased use of renewables. Although not necessarily its goal, the Military-Environmental Complex thus has the potential to unleash important spillover effects in the sphere of values, behavior, and policy.

The consecutive selection, planning, implementation, and verification of regulatory measures or technology applications require a tool battery which is adapted to the environmental activity to manage. Part of the impacts can be measured and characterized by absolute values such as monetized benefits. Others can be characterized on a relative scale by comparing them to each other or to a reference value. The evaluation can be prospective or retrospective. Verification of an environmental measure or technology is a generic regulatory process resulting in a certificate for a technology whose appropriateness and efficacy have been proved in general, or it may refer to a site-specific application, where the technology has either fulfilled the requirements or appeared to be capable of achieving the planned target. This chapter introduces the environmental risk assessment (ERA), socio-economic assessment (SEA), multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) tools. These tools are used for the assessment of environmental problems caused by chemical substances or contaminated sites, for the selection of the best possible risk reduction measure (comparative evaluation), monitoring the applied measure/technology (maintaining optimal operation), post-application assessment, and verification of the applied measure/technology by efficiency assessment and approval. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.","","Contamination; Environmental technology; Health risks; Life cycle; Risk management; Application assessments; Comparative evaluations; Environmental activities; Environmental risk assessment; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Risk reduction measures; Social and economic impacts; Socio-economic assessments; Risk assessment","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84995705237",NA,NA

The challenge is that the topic of sustainability can seem overwhelming and there is limited information that is specific to the food industry. Written by an experienced food industry professional with years of experience in sustainability, The10 Principles of Food Industry Sustainability inspires and informs the progress required to nourish the population, revitalize natural resources, enhance economic development, and close resource loops. The book makes this complex topic approachable and actionable by identifying the most pressing sustainability priorities across the entire food supply chain and showing, with tools and examples, how producers, processors, packers, distributors, marketers and retailers all play a role in advancing improvement. The book begins with an overview of the Principles of sustainability in the food industry: what they are and why they matter. Subsequent chapters focus on each of the Ten Principles in detail: how they relate to the food industry, their global relevance (including their environmental, health, and social impacts), and the best practices to achieve the potential of meaningful and positive progress that the Principles offer. Specific examples from industry are presented in order to provide scalable solutions and bring the concepts to life, along with top resources for further exploration. The Principles, practices, and potential of sustainability in the food industry covered in this book are designed to be motivating and to offer a much-needed and clear way forward towards a sustainable food supply. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Despite advancements in technology, however, some three billion people, primarily in the rural areas of developing countries, continue to meet their energy needs for cooking through traditional means by burning biomass resources (i.e., firewood, crop residues and animal dung) in crude traditional stoves. Such practices are known to be the source of significant environmental, social, economic and public health issues. To achieve sustainable development in these regions, it is imperative that access to clean and affordable (renewable) energy is made available. Within this context, upgrading existing biomass resources (i.e., animal manure, crop residues, kitchen waste and green wastes) to cleaner and more efficient energy carriers (such as biogas from anaerobic digestion) has unique potential to provide clean and reliable energy, while simultaneously preserving the local and global environment. In spite of its significant potential to serve developing nations, however, the high costs and lack of expertise in installation and maintenance of biogas technology preclude widespread adoption in geographically isolated communities. Concerted efforts from both governmental and non-governmental sectors are absolutely essential in facilitating modernization and dissemination of biogas technology to harness the inherent potential that is currently underutilized and unexploited. The intent of this paper seeks to highlight the present status, challenges, and potential of biogas technology to advocate for further research, development and dissemination of the concept in developing countries. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Anaerobic digestion; Bioenergy; Biogas; Developing countries; Greenhouse gas; Manure; Wastes","Animals; Biogas; Biomass; Crops; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Economics; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Modernization; Sustainable development; Wastes; Bio-energy; Biogas technologies; Developing nations; Global environment; Isolated community; Public health issues; Socio-economic development; Sustainable energy sources; Anaerobic digestion","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84893046059",NA,NA

However, benthic P budgets of specific ecosystem compartments such as macrophyte-dominated reef lagoons are still scarce. To address this, we quantified individual and lagoon-wide net (Pn) and gross (Pg) primary production by all dominant functional groups of benthic primary producers in a typical macrophyte-dominated Caribbean reef lagoon near Puerto Morelos (Mexico) via measurement of O2 fluxes in incubation experiments. The photosynthetically active 3D lagoon surface area was quantified using conversion factors to allow extrapolation to lagoon-wide P budgets. Findings revealed that lagoon 2D benthic cover was primarily composed of sand-associated microphytobenthos (40%), seagrasses (29%) and macroalgae (27%), while seagrasses dominated the lagoon 3D surface area (84%). Individual Pg was highest for macroalgae and scleractinian corals (87 and 86 mmol O2 m-2 specimen area d-1, respectively), however seagrasses contributed highest (59%) to the lagoon-wide Pg. Macroalgae exhibited highest individual Pn rates, but seagrasses generated the largest fraction (51%) of lagoon-wide Pn. Individual R was highest for scleractinian corals and macroalgae, whereas seagrasses again provided the major lagoon-wide share (68%). These findings characterise the investigated lagoon as a net autotrophic coral reef ecosystem compartment revealing similar P compared to other macrophyte-dominated coastal environments such as seagrass meadows and macroalgae beds. Further, high lagoon-wide P (Pg: 488 and P n: 181 mmol O2 m-2 lagoon area d-1) and overall Pg:R (1.6) indicate substantial benthic excess production within the Puerto Morelos reef lagoon and suggest the export of newly synthesised organic matter to surrounding ecosystems. © 2013 Naumann et al.","","organic matter; article; benthos; biomass production; Central America; coastal waters; controlled study; coral; coral reef; environmental impact; lagoon; macroalga; macrobenthos; marine environment; Mexico; microphytobenthos; nonhuman; oxygen transport; seagrass; species dominance; species habitat; Animals; Anthozoa; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Mexico; Seaweed","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84893344769",NA,NA

But this need not be the case. Many carbon reduction policies provide a range of additional benefits, from reduced air pollution and increased energy security to financial savings and healthier lifestyles, that can offset the costs of climate action. This book maps out the links between low carbon policies and their co-benefits, and shows how low carbon policies can lead to cleaner air and water, conservation of forests, more sustainable agriculture, less waste, safer and more secure energy, cost savings for households and businesses and a stronger and more stable economy. The book discusses the ways in which joined-up policies can help to maximise the synergies and minimise the conflicts between climate policy and other aspects of sustainability. Through rigorous analysis of the facts, the author presents well-reasoned and evidenced recommendations for policy-makers and all those with an interest in making a healthier and happier society.

Such 'ghost nets' cause the by-catch of marine fauna and require retrieval from coastlines where they wash up. Identifying the causes of discarded nets and feasible intervention points requires analysis of a complex value chain and the stakeholders within it, yet no studies have attempted this. In this paper we combine Value Chain Analysis, commonly applied to understand value-adding for a commodity, with elements of Life Cycle Assessment and social network analysis to examine the drivers, stakeholders, economic, environmental and social costs and benefits in the life of a trawl net. We use the Arafura Sea as a case study, which is shared by Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia, and is the focus of a Trans-boundary Diagnostic Assessment (TDA) within the Arafura-Timor Seas Ecosystem Action program (ATSEA). We follow a trawl net through four sub-systems: manufacture of webbing in South Korea, fishing and loss by an Indonesian vessel, retrieval as ghost net on the northern Australian coastline by Indigenous rangers, and disposal or re-cycling as 'GhostNet Art' by Indigenous artists. Primary stakeholders along the value chain incur economic and social benefits, and economic and environmental costs. There is an anomaly in the chain between Indonesian fishermen and Indigenous rangers, artists and communities due to the lack of market linkages between these primary stakeholders. The first 'nexus of influence' where reductions in net losses and environmental costs can be achieved is through interactions between GhostNets Australia, the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Australian Government, which can influence Indonesian fishery management institutions and fishing crews. The second nexus is via the international art market which by publicising GhostNet Art can raise awareness amongst fish consumers about the impacts of ghost nets, and hence influence Indonesian fishing companies. GhostNets Australia is a key bridging organisation in the network, linking stakeholders across scales and sub-systems. Feasible preventative interventions are discussed to rectify the anomaly in the value chain. The importance of GhostNets Australia and ATSEA in the evolving adaptive co-management and trans-boundary governance of fisheries is highlighted. However, the prevention of ghost nets will result in trade-offs in benefits for the livelihoods of primary stakeholders. The utility of the method for analysing marine debris in TDAs, and ATSEA in particular, is discussed. © 2013.","Adaptive co-management; Indigenous rangers; Life Cycle Assessment; Marine debris; Social networks; Trans-boundary Diagnostic Assessment","adaptive management; bycatch; coast; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; marine ecosystem; social network; stakeholder; trade-off; transboundary cooperation; trawl net; Arafura Sea; article; Australia; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; economic aspect; environment; environmental management; feasibility study; fishery management; fishing; fishing net; government; human; Indonesia; life cycle assessment; Papua New Guinea; recycling; reduction; seashore; social network; South Korea; statistical analysis; value chain analysis; Australia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fisheries; Indonesia; Oceans and Seas; Papua New Guinea; Waste Products; Arafura Sea; Australia; Indonesia; Lesser Sunda Islands; Pacific Ocean; Papua New Guinea; South Korea; Sunda Isles; Timor","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84876329459",NA,NA

There are some three billion people in these regions, however, who lack consistent access to energy and rely on traditional solid fuels such as firewood, cattle manure, and crop residues for meeting cooking and heating needs. Excessive use of such highly polluting resources creates serious environmental, social and public health issues. In this context, household digesters (which convert readily available feedstocks such as cattle manure, human excreta, and crop residues into biogas) have the potential to play a significant role in supplying methane as a clean, renewable energy resource for remote geographies. In addition to bioenergy production, the slurry generated from anaerobic digestion is rich in nutrients and can improve the physical, chemical, and biological attributes of soil when applied to agricultural land. This type of approach has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously improving the quality of life. Despite a long history of research and innovation for the development and optimization of household digesters, little is known and has been reported for the application of these systems in decentralized communities. The primary purpose of this paper seeks to review the dearth of literature pertaining to small-scale anaerobic digesters in remote geographies and in regions where much of the world's population reside. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.","bioenergy; biogas; developing countries; digester design; household digester","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Developing countries; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Methane; Pulp digesters; Rural areas; Agricultural land; Anaerobic digester; Bio-energy; Bioenergy productions; Consistent access; Household digesters; Public health issues; Quality of life; Heating; ammonia; biogas; hydrocarbon; hydrogen sulfide; methane; nitrogen; organic fertilizer; organic matter; polyethylene; agricultural land; bioenergy; biogas; developing world; digestion; energy resource; greenhouse gas; manure; public health; agricultural land; agriculture; anaerobic digestion; article; bioenergy; carbon footprint; cattle; chemical composition; combustion; cooking; developed country; developing country; electricity; energy consumption; energy yield; feces; geography; heating; household; illumination; livestock; manure; organic waste; physical chemistry; plant residue; quality of life; renewable energy; soil analysis; water vapor; Bos","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84886095428",NA,NA

However, the fluxes, fates and environmental consequences of industrial Nr (excluding synthesized N fertilizer) remain poorly understood and quantified. We report here that industrial Nr flux has increased 13. 4-fold over the past 30 years in China, reaching 3. 7 Tg N (1 Tg = 1012 g) in 2008, accounting for over 50% of China's food Nr flux. Socioeconomic development (per capita GDP, urbanization and household size) significantly drives the growth of industrial Nr fluxes. This leads to ""hotspots"" of industrial Nr, mainly in relatively developed Eastern China. Industrial Nr loss rate during production is only 5%, much lower than that of cropland (50%) and livestock (80%). However, industrial Nr loss is point source pollution, and Nr release in concentrated doses produces serious risk in small regions. The contribution of structural N to total industrial Nr with a lifespan longer than one year (e. g., synthetic fiber, plastic) increased from 20% in 1980 to 70% in 2008. There was about 2. 6 Tg N structural industrial Nr accumulated in human settlements in 2008, which could be one explanation of an unknown Nr sink of anthropogenic Nr input (mainly Haber-Bosch N fixation). Legacy effects caused by structural N accumulation have long-term consequences for environmental and human health, although structural N delays Nr release and reduces short-term Nr pollution. Industrial Nr use generates new features of modern global N biogeochemistry, such as increasing Nr species diversity, reducing Nr turnover rate. Future dynamics simulation of the earth system should involve industrial Nr. Explicit consideration and accounting of the fluxes and environmental consequences of industrial Nr would provide decision-makers a novel view of regional sustainable development. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","food nitrogen; garbage siege; legacy effect; point source pollution; structural nitrogen","Biodiversity; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Pollution; Dynamics simulation; Environmental consequences; garbage siege; Industrial nitrogen; legacy effect; Point source pollution; Regional sustainable development; Socio-economic development; Sustainable development; biogeochemistry; concentration (composition); decision making; emission inventory; environmental impact; human activity; industrial emission; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen fixation; point source pollution; sustainable development; China","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84876024168",NA,NA

Cumulative farmlands in China, which total 26.867 million hectares in area, have been returned for use in forestry or as pastures. Moreover, a national average rate of 36.67 g·m-2·yr-1 soil organic carbon sequestration in the top 20 cm soil was achieved after the programs implementation. In addition, the program has made surplus labour more sustainable and has created more lucrative activities that significantly improved the economic structure of rural China. The GTGP has also improved the socio-economic well-being of most participant households. Therefore, the GTGP has been proven to achieve favourable ecological results, increase farmers' net incomes, and make a profound social impact.","Ecological effect; Economic benefit; Grain-to-Green Program; Social impacts","organic carbon; agricultural management; agricultural worker; article; biological activity; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; China; community program; crop; cultivated land; ecology; economics; ecosystem; environmental impact; food security; forestry; grain; greenhouse effect; human; income; land use; pasture; policy; rural population; socioeconomics; soil degradation; soil erosion","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84891914466",NA,NA

Although soil is a non-renewable natural resource, humans have increasingly used it as a contaminant sink ever since the Industrial Revolution. Pollution endangers natural soil mechanisms that allow the soil to keep itself in balance and compromises the supply of soil-based goods and services. Detrimental effects of contaminants on soil microbiota may be directly related to loss of biodiversity and functions such as the recycling of nutrients. However, this direct negative effect is still debated among microbial ecologists because microbial communities may be surprisingly resilient (i.e. able to recover from contamination effects) and/or functionally redundant. Likewise, the potential toxicity of soil contamination to humans is controversial as investigations on the mix of different contaminants are very limited. Due to accumulated evidence of the potential toxicity of single contaminants on human health and animals, mostly based on in vitro or in vivo assays, international guidelines, such as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, have established a list of priority contaminants. Despite worldwide concern about soil contamination, Europe still lacks a common soil legislative tool because the proposed Soil Directive Framework is currently under negotiation. The lack of a European directive is nevertheless compensated by national policies at the member state level. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Ecological risk; Environmental legislation; Health risk; Soil contaminant; Soil microorganism","","Book Chapter","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-85042470507",NA,NA

Other ECs produced either naturally or anthropogenically ultimately flow into marine waters. Pharmaceuticals are also an important pollution source, mostly due to overproduction and incorrect disposal. Ship breaking and recycle industries (SBRIs) can also release various pollutants and substantially deteriorate habitats and marine biodiversity. Overfishing is significantly increasing due to the global food crisis, caused by an increasing world population. Organic matter (OM) pollution and global warming (GW) are key factors that exacerbate these challenges (e.g. algal blooms), to which acidification in marine waters should be added as well. Sources, factors, mechanisms and possible remedial measures of these challenges to marine ecosystems are discussed, including their eventual impact on all forms of life including humans. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd","Acidification; Algal blooms; Overfishing; Pharmaceuticals; Ship breaking","Acidification; Biodiversity; Drug products; Ecology; Ecosystems; Global warming; Metabolites; Pollution; Produced Water; Ships; Water pollution; Algal blooms; Emerging contaminant (ECs); Marine biodiversity; Overfishing; Pollution sources; Remedial measures; Ship breaking; World population; Marine pollution; algal toxin; antibiotic agent; antineoplastic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; carbamazepine; cosmetic; diclofenac; endocrine disruptor; estrogen derivative; fibric acid derivative; fluoxetine; ibuprofen; personal care product; plant toxin; propranolol; pyrrole derivative; red tide toxin; serotonin; sertraline; steroid; sulfonamide; unclassified drug; acidification; awareness; biodiversity; Bluefin tuna; cod; cytotoxicity; disorders of mitochondrial functions; drug contamination; effluent toxicity; egg production; energy metabolism; environmental impact; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; hazardous waste site; Hilsa fish; human; immune system; intestine; marine environment; nonhuman; overfishing; oxidative stress; pH; photosynthesis; reproduction; Review; sea; sexual disruption; spermatogenesis; spermatozoon count; waste disposal; water pollution; water quality; algae","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84891593005",NA,NA

The book details several key fields within forestry, including forest health, economics, policy, utilization, and forestry careers. Chapters deal specifically with forest products and harvesting, recreation, wildlife habitats, tree anatomy and physiology, and ethics. These topics are ideal for undergraduate introductory courses and include numerous examples (mainly graphical) and questions for students to ponder. Unlike other introductory forestry texts, which focus largely on forest ecology rather than practical forestry concepts, Introduction to Forestry and Natural Resources encompasses economic, ecological, and social aspects providing a uniquely balanced text.

Finite fossil fuels. Fresh water depletion. Rising commodity prices. Ocean acidification. Overpopulation. Deforestation. Feeding the world's billions. We're beset by an array of natural resource and environmental challenges. They pose a tremendous risk to human prosperity, to world peace, and to the planet itself. Yet, if we act, these problems are addressable. Throughout history we've overcome similar problems, but only when we've focused our energies on innovation. For the most valuable resource we have isn't oil, water, gold, or land - it's our stockpile of useful ideas, and our continually growing capacity to expand them. In this remarkable book, Ramez Naam charts a course to supercharge innovation - by changing the rules of our economy - that can lead the whole world to greater wealth and human well-being, even as we dodge looming resource crunches and environmental disasters and reduce our impact on the planet. ""Most books about the future are written by blinkered Pollyannas or hand-wringing Cassandras. Ramez Naam--Egypt-born, Illinois-raised, a major contributor to the computer revolution--is neither. Having thought about science, technology and the environment for decades, he has become that rarest of creatures: A clear-eyed optimist. Concise, informed and passionately argued, The Infinite Resource both acknowledges the very real dangers that lie ahead for the human enterprise and the equally real possibility that we might not only survive but thrive."" --Charles Mann, New York Times bestselling author of 1491 and 1493 ""An amazing book.

In tackling the major challenges of our age, such as resource depletion, loss of biodiversity and climate change, health services can play a central role, moving from being part of the problem to becoming part of the solution. Sustainable Healthcare explores questions such as: What is the relevance of sustainability in healthcare? How does climate change threaten human health? How can we create low carbon care pathways? How can healthcare organizations deal better with their waste? How can death and dying become more sustainable? How can we engage ourselves and others with this agenda? Written by an international team combining clinical, educational, practical and policy expertise in sustainability and health, this book provides a synopsis of our current predicaments, and explores some of the emerging solutions. Containing case studies and resources for further information and action, Sustainable Healthcare is a practical guide to making healthcare more sustainable for all healthcare professionals, managers and students. ""Once in a while one comes across a book that makes a deep impact. Sustainable Healthcare is such a book and very timely in the context of modern healthcare and developing green policies...

In certain countries, a transition to an open society and free market is superimposed on the transition to sustainability, resulting in even higher complexity of management. This paper proposes an approach for problem-structuring of landfills in complex transitions: sustainability or unsustainability of a management approach is determined by a set of sustainability filters that are defined by sets of indicators and prioritized according the systemic concept of sustainability, which says that economy is embedded in society, which is embedded in nature. The writers exercise this approach with an old landfill in Iasi, Romania, and conclude for unsustainability, because the ecological sustainability filter is not successfully passed. Social and economic sustainability filters are also discussed in relation with the ecological sustainability indicators. The described approach allows a coherent, transdisciplinary synthesis of knowledge scattered across various disciplines, a pervasive problem in landfill management. The case study helps distinguish between generally true and context-dependent aspects. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Central Europe; Municipal solid waste; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable development; Transdisciplinary studies","Central Europe; Complex problems; Complex transitions; Context dependent; Ecological sustainability; Economic sustainability; Free market; Landfill management; Managerial practices; Romania; Sustainability indicators; Transdisciplinary studies; Urban wastes; Ecology; Municipal solid waste; Sustainable development; Land fill; landfill; management practice; municipal solid waste; sustainability; sustainable development; Iasi; Romania","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-84860317562",NA,NA

Biological effects are introduced from the biochemical level up to ecosystems, covering all toxicological aspects. Impacts of pollution by persistent chemicals are considered from a socio-economic point of view. Manifestation of effects from individual to ecosystem level is considered and evaluated as well as their consequences for management of coastal and estuarine ecosystems. The Seine (France) is presented as a case study as it appears as one of the most contaminated estuaries in the world for the majority of metals listed in the European Water Framework Directive (Cd, Hg, Pb, Zn, and, to a lesser extent, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Ace) and also for elevated levels of micropollutants in general. Gaps in knowledge and necessary research in the field are finally discussed. Dynamic laboratory simulations of processes affecting chemical species in their transit through estuaries are currently being developed to characterize littoral systems.

Life cycle assessment methodology has also been applied to economies, trade between countries, aspects of production and to waste management, including CO2 capture and sequestration. Life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions are often part of wider environmental assessments, which also cover other environmental impacts. Such wider ranging assessments allow for considering ""trade-offs"" between (reduction of) greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts and co-benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Databases exist which contain estimates of current greenhouse gas emissions linked to fossil fuel use and to many current agricultural and industrial activities. However these data bases do allow for substantial uncertainties in emission estimates. Assessments of greenhouse gas emissions linked to new processes and products are subject to even greater data-linked uncertainty. Variability in outcomes of life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions may furthermore originate in different choices regarding functional units, system boundaries, time horizons, and the allocation of greenhouse gas emissions to outputs in multi-output processes. Life cycle assessments may be useful in the identification of life cycle stages that are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and of major reduction options, in the verification of alleged climate benefits and to establish major differences between competing products. They may also be helpful in the analysis and development of options, policies, and innovations aimed at mitigation of climate change. The main findings from available life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions are summarized, offering guidance in mitigating climate change. Future directions in developing life cycle assessment and its application are indicated. These include: Better handling of indirect effects, of uncertainty, and of changes in carbon stock of recent biogenic origin; and improved comprehensiveness in dealing with climate warming. © 2012.

Indeed, elemental ratios are used as an index for functional differences between plants and their responses to natural or anthropogenic variations in nutrient supply. We investigated the variation in growth and elemental content of the rootless terrestrial bromeliad Tillandsia landbeckii, which obtains its moisture, and likely its nutrients, from coastal fogs in the Atacama Desert. We assessed (1) how fog nutrient supply influences plant growth and stoichiometry and (2) the response of plant growth and stoichiometry to variations in nutrient supply by using reciprocal transplants. We hypothesized that T. landbeckii should exhibit physiological and biochemical plastic responses commensurate with nutrient supply from atmospheric deposition. In the case of the Atacama Desert, nutrient supply from fog is variable over space and time, which suggests a relatively high variation in the growth and elemental content of atmospheric bromeliads. We found that the nutrient content of T. landbeckii showed high spatio-temporal variability, driven partially by fog nutrient deposition but also by plant growth rates. Reciprocal transplant experiments showed that transplanted individuals converged to similar nutrient content, growth rates, and leaf production of resident plants at each site, reflecting local nutrient availability. Although plant nutrient content did not exactly match the relative supply of N and P, our results suggest that atmospheric nutrient supply is a dominant driver of plant growth and stoichiometry. In fact, our results indicate that N uptake by T. landbeckii plants depends more on N supplied by fog, whereas P uptake is mainly regulated by within-plant nutrient demand for growth. Overall, these findings indicate that variation in fog nutrient supply exerts a strong control over growth and nutrient dynamics of atmospheric plants, which are ubiquitous across fog-dominated ecosystems. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Atmospheric deposition; Ephiphytes; Growth rate; Nitrogen; Nutrient ratios; Nutrient supply; Phosphorus","nitrogen; phosphorus; arid environment; assessment method; atmospheric deposition; biochemical composition; biological uptake; carbon; developmental biology; ecosystem service; fog; growth rate; herb; moisture; monocotyledon; nitrogen; nutrient availability; phosphorus; physiological response; spatiotemporal analysis; stochasticity; terrestrial environment; article; atmosphere; chemistry; Chile; desert climate; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; soil; weather; Atmosphere; Chile; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plants; Soil; Weather; Atacama Desert; Chile; Tillandsia; Tillandsia landbeckii","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-80054035321",NA,NA

These change phenomena included agricultural encroachment, sand dune afforestation, coastline changes and removal/expansion of reed beds. The percentage overall accuracies of different algebra products for each phenomenon were calculated and compared. The results showed that some of the changes such as sand dune afforestation and reed bed expansion were detected with accuracies varying between 85 and 97% by the majority of the algebra operations, while some other changes such as logging could only be detected by mid-infrared (MIR) ratioing.

Although a number of studies have identified shifts in functional groups or biological traits in relation to anthropogenic stressors, there have been few field-based assessments of changes in functioning associated with stress gradients. We used a comparative experimental approach to investigate functioning on two sandflats with differing exposures to urban contaminants. Apart from significant differences in sediment contaminant concentrations (43.2±1.8mgkg-1 Zn and 15.6±0.9mgkg-1 Pb at the Pollen site; 17.7±0.7mgkg-1 Zn and 7.9±0.9mgkg-1 Pb at the Waiheke site), the two sandflats were readily comparable: both had similar sediment grain size distributions and were dominated by the same macrofaunal species; and both were in non-eutrophic New Zealand marine reserves with low ambient sediment organic matter content. To better understand the effects of contaminants on biologically mediated transformations of organic matter into inorganic nutrients, we manipulated sediment organic matter content and macrofaunal abundance in standardized treatments at each site. Fluxes of oxygen and ammonium, which are linked to key sandflat processes such as organic matter decomposition and benthic photosynthesis, were measured as response variables 1week after the experimental manipulations. We predicted more efficient organic matter processing on the uncontaminated flat and thus expected to see elevated ammonium efflux in response to organic enrichment treatments at this site. Higher rates of benthic photosynthesis were predicted for plots with higher ammonium efflux, as ammonium is a readily utilizable form of limiting inorganic nitrogen. We documented significant positive relationships between ammonium uptake and benthic primary production on the uncontaminated flat, but weaker/insignificant relationships at the contaminated site. Our data were consistent with theories of increased variability and a decoupling of system processes with increasing amounts of stress. © 2010 The Authors.

Subsequently, in the period 1952-1986 scientific and technologically based innovation applied to farming increased yields by an average value of 2.6% pa. It is predicted that wheat yields will rise to 10.48-13.69 t ha-1 by 2015, with a current theoretical biological ceiling of 19.2 t ha-1 (Britton 1990). These rising yields have been accompanied by a tenfold increase in the amount of nitrogen applied to wheat in 1943/1945-1994 (Houghton 1996). They represent one example of what has been achieved by a combination of genotype (plant breeding) and environmental modification increasing the nutrients available to the plant in step with its physiological demands and fending-off consequential invasions by pests and pathogens attendant on rapid growth and high yields. Burgeoning human populations, reaching an estimated 10 billion by 2050, demand that similar yield increases are continued and accelerated. The environmental and climatic consequences arising from a policy of raising yield solely by increasing inputs are becoming apparent as dangerously unsustainable. Dramatic changes in the manner by which crops are husbanded are required with the aim of achieving increased yield but with minimal damage to the world's ecosystems (Dixon and Margerison 2009). Concomitant with the need to continue and accelerate yield increases in order to fill empty stomachs and enhance lifestyles far greater control of pests and pathogens using intelligent, integrated and environmentally benign methods based on sound scientific knowledge of the intimate relationships of beneficial microbes, roots, soil and pest and pathogen biology is required for the health of our planet's environment and biodiversity. So far, our knowledge of soil -microbiology is at best scant and fragmentary and at worst non-existent.

Photosynthetic biofuel production represents one of these since for this, one uses renewable resources. Sunlight is used for the conversion of water and CO 2 into biomass. Two strategies are used in parallel: plant-based production via sugar fermentation into ethanol and biodiesel production through transesterification. Both, however, exacerbate other problems, including regional nutrient balancing and the world's food supply, and suffer from the modest efficiency of photosynthesis. Maximizing the efficiency of natural and engineered photosynthesis is therefore of utmost importance. Algal photosynthesis is the system of choice for this particularly for energy applications. Complete conversion of CO 2 into biomass is not necessary for this. Innovative methods of synthetic biology allow one to combine photosynthetic and fermentative metabolism via the so-called Photanol approach to form biofuel directly from Calvin cycle intermediates through use of the naturally transformable cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Beyond providing transport energy and chemical feedstocks, photosynthesis will continue to be used for food and feed applications. Also for this application, arguments of efficiency will become more and more important as the size of the world population continues to increase. Photosynthetic cells can be used for food applications in various innovative forms, e.g., as a substitute for the fish proteins in the diet supplied to carnivorous fish or perhaps-after acid hydrolysis-as a complex, animal-free serum for growth of mammalian cells in vitro. © 2010 The Author(s).","Biofuel; Energy conversion; Feed and food applications; Oxygenic photosynthesis; Synechocystis sp.

The Brundtland Report argued that not only was it achievable, but that it was an urgent imperative in order to achieve a transition to sustainable development while significantly reducing poverty and driving 'clean and green' investment. With some still arguing for significantly slowing economic growth in order to reduce pressures on the environment, this new book, Cents and Sustainability, shows that it is possible to reconcile the need for economic growth and environmental sustainability through a strategy to decouple economic growth from environmental pressures, combined with a renewed commitment to achieve significant environmental restoration and poverty reduction. Beginning with a brief overview of some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, the book then explains 'decoupling theory', overviews a number of factors that can undermine and even block efforts to decouple in both developed and developing countries, and then discusses a number of key considerations to assist the development of national 'decoupling strategies'. The book then focuses on presenting evidence to support greater action, not just on climate change, but also on decoupling economic growth from the loss of biodiversity and the deterioration of natural systems, freshwater extraction, waste production, and air pollution. In the lead up to the 2012 United Nations Earth Summit and beyond, Cents and Sustainability will be a crucial guide to inform and assist nations to develop strategies to significantly reduce environmental pressures, strengthen their economy, create jobs and reduce poverty.

With the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme climate events predicted in current climate change scenarios, also competition for N between plants and/or soil microorganisms will be affected. In this review, we summarize the present understanding of ecosystem N cycling in N-limited forests and its interaction with extreme climate events, such as heat, drought and flooding. More specifically, the impacts of environmental stresses on microbial release and consumption of bioavailable N, N uptake and competition between plants, as well as plant and microbial uptake are presented. Furthermore, the consequences of drying-wetting cycles on N cycling are discussed. Additionally, we highlight the current methodological difficulties that limit present understanding of N cycling in forest ecosystems and the need for interdisciplinary studies. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Decomposition; Drought; Flood; Heat; Immobilization; N mineralization; Nitrification; Soil N cycling","nitrogen; chemistry; climate change; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiological stress; plant; review; soil; tree; Climate Change; Nitrogen; Plants; Soil; Stress, Physiological; Trees","Review","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-74049151636",NA,NA

However, the Holocene (the geological interval spanning the last 11,500 years from the end of the last glaciation) has witnessed massive levels of extinctions that have continued into the modern historical era, but in a context of only relatively minor climatic fluctuations. This makes a detailed consideration of these extinctions a useful system for investigating the impacts of human activity over time. This book describes and analyses the range of global extinction events which have occurred during this key time period, as well as their relationship to both earlier and ongoing species losses. By integrating information from fields as diverse as zoology, ecology, palaeontology, archaeology, and geography, and by incorporating data from a broad range of taxonomic groups and ecosystems, this text provides a fascinating insight into human impacts on global extinction rates, both past and present. © Oxford University Press, 2013.","Archaeology; Biodiversity loss; Environmental change; Extinct species; Fossil record; Palaeontology; Quaternary","","Book","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-77955727013",NA,NA

This study presents an analysis of risk to freshwater ecosystems from silver released from these nanoparticles incorporated into textiles and plastics. The analysis is presented in four stages; (i) silver mass flow analysis and estimation of emissions, (ii) assessment of the fate of silver in a river system and estimation of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs), (iii) critical evaluation of available toxicity data for environmentally relevant forms of silver and estimation of predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs), and (iv) risk characterization. Our assessment is based on estimated silver use in the year 2010, focusing on the Rhine river as a case study. In 2010, biocidal plastics and textiles are predicted to account for up to 15% of the total silver released into water in the European Union. The majority of silver released into wastewater is incorporated into sewage sludge and may be spread on agricultural fields. The amount of silver reaching natural waters depends on the fraction of wastewater that is effectively treated. Modeled PECs in the Rhine river are in satisfactory agreement with monitoring data from other river systems. Because a complete characterization of the toxicity of environmentally relevant silver species is lacking, only a limited risk assessment is possible at this time. However, our study indicates that PEC/PNEC ratios greater than 1 cannot be ruled out for freshwater ecosystems, in particular sediments. No risk is predicted for microbial communities in sewage treatment plants. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This paper discusses angling patterns within a framework of basic ecological and evolutionary literature and examines potential biological impacts of angling by focusing on study results associated with high exploitation rates and pronounced selective exploitation. The impacts range from impacts occurring directly on the exploited species (truncation of the natural age and size structure, depensatory mechanisms, loss of genetic variability, evolutionary changes), to those that occur on the aquatic ecosystem (changes in trophic cascades, trait-mediated effects). As a third category, impacts related to the angling activity per se are distinguished (habitat modifications, wildlife disturbance, nutrient inputs, loss of fishing gear). Although the main threats to fish often are localized outside recreational fisheries, there is growing evidence that angling and angling associated activities can lead to a decline of fish populations and affect aquatic ecosystems in various ways provided that the degree of the fishing mortality is high and the selective exploitation is intensive. In conclusion, management implications for sustainable recreational fisheries and areas for future research are outlined.

The European Union is implementing product-oriented environmental regulation based on the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (""EPR""), which assigns responsibility to manufacturers to take back their products after consumers discard them. In theory, EPR could dramatically alter production practices by internalizing externalities from products and providing incentives for environmentally friendly design. However, practical problems of implementation raise questions about the effectiveness of EPR as a policy tool. This Article explores the European experience with EPR, the reasons for apparent resistance to EPR in the United States, and the implications of a move toward product-oriented environmental law. It critiques EPR on the grounds that the transaction costs of EPR may outweigh its environmental benefits and that practical problems of implementation may preclude the achievement of expected product design incentives. Given the substantial cost and technical hurdles to establishing the legal underpinnings of EPR programs, this Article recommends that the United States consider alternative policy instruments to address environmental externalities from products.","","economic policy; economic theory; government","Article","Final",NA,"Scopus","2-s2.0-33645941522",NA,NA

This paper discusses the second kind of complexity and the ecological issues in the different disciplines. Economic value, as expressed by market price, depends on whether limits on resources and the Earth's services due to the scale of human technological activities are taken into account. Human activities relative to the Earth's ecology require sustainability consideration. Two important stands on sustainability are discussed. Mainstream sustainability is a stand for continued economic growth to foster advances in technology to overcome the limits of the Earth. It requires technological activities to follow green chemistry and green engineering principles to develop innovations that are ecologically considerate. Environmental sustainability is a stand to stay within forecasted limits in the resources and renewability capacity of the Earth. The technology for this further includes using the principles of industrial ecology to locate ways to use wastes and recycle products as source materials for other processes to make and close material cycles. Chemical engineering innovations for increased atomic utilization of reactants, efficiency in energy use, dematerialization, non-toxicity, recyclability, and creative systemic cycling of materials for waste management are good for the ecology. Case studies are given showing the utility of following the principles developed for good ecological practice. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
