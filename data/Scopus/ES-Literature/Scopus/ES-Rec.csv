Here, we demonstrate the application of regime shift theory to one of California's newest and deepest reservoirs, Diamond Valley Lake (DVL), which in recent years showed an unexpected rapid departure from its water quality conditions of the previous decade. The reservoir shifted from a well oxygenated condition with low phytoplankton growth to a hypoxic, phytoplankton-dominated turbid system. We statistically identified the critical stressor (phosphorus (P)), switch points, and its load threshold and characterized its transition to an alternative stable state and the stabilizing mechanisms contributing to hysteresis. We analyzed long-term environmental, chemical and flow data, conducted a hydrographic survey, and developed a hydrodynamic model to characterize the factors that contributed to regime shift and to evaluate different management strategies that might reverse this shift. Our findings indicate that large deep systems exhibit different transition dynamics in the presence of an acute stressor compared to regime shifts in shallow systems. A cumulative external TP load threshold of 4.6 mg m−2 d−1 added to the reservoir over nearly 11 months was identified as the critical stressor. For large deep systems, inherent morphometric features such as large relative depth combine with external stressors to drive regime shifts. Light winds, morphometric conditions impeding deep mixing, and a stable stratification that lasts up to 9 months makes DVL more susceptible to hypolimnetic hypoxia, an intrinsic factor accelerating regime shift. Results also suggest regime shift occurred in 2013, when new limnological processes were established to reinforce the new alternative stable state and existing ecosystem services were impaired. Interactions between hypoxia, internal P loading (~2.1 mg m−2 d−1), and seasonal cyanobacterial blooms were identified as mechanisms perpetuating the new alternative state. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","CE-QUAL-W2; Critical external phosphorus loading threshold; Cyanobacteria; Geosmin; Hypoxia; Internal phosphorus recycling","Chemical analysis; Climate change; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Lakes; Phosphorus; Reservoir management; Water quality; CE-QUAL-w2; Condition; Critical external phosphorus loading threshold; Critical stressors; Cyanobacterium; Deep reservoirs; Geosmin; Hypoxia; Internal phosphorus recycling; Regime shift; Reservoirs (water); cyanobacterium; hydrological change; hydrological regime; hypoxia; lake; morphometry; phosphorus; phytoplankton; reservoir; California; United States; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103797930

Objective: to compare age-related changes in root traits and their relationship with internal N recycling in two co-generic perennial species differing in their resource-use strategy and plant lifespan. We hypothesized that the root system of both species will become more conservative with age, but the root system of the acquisitive short-lived Physaria pinetorum (Brassicaceae) will decrease its acquisition capacity while the conservative long-lived P. mendocina will increase its storage capacity. Results and conclusion: we confirmed that the root system of both species shifts from acquisitive to conservative with age, reducing N acquisition and relying either on N translocation from leaves or root stores to sustain growth and grain filling. As hypothesized, the species responded differentially according to their longevity and resource-use strategy: P. pinetorum showed a great loss of acquisition and storage capacities with absolute age, and turned to N stores when acquisition was deficient while P. mendocina increased storage capacity with age and obtained N from resorption to sustain allocation to grain, decreasing the quality of its litter. Species differing in their plant lifespan and resource use strategies have different patterns of N dynamics with age, that could affect yield stability and the provision of ecosystem services. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","N leaf; N resorption; N storage; Proficiency; RTD; SRL","experimental study; grass; longevity; nitrogen cycle; nutrient dynamics; perennial plant; physiology; resorption; resource use; root system; translocation; Brassicaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102274474

This is particularly true for phosphorus (P) recycling by bacterial activity. Here, we studied the physicochemical properties, P contents, phosphomonoesterase (Pase) activities, and bacterial Pase genes (phoD, phoC, and phoX) in Chilean river sediments (Imperial and Toltén rivers, Chile) collected in sites with less and more degrees of anthropogenic influence during the summer and winter seasons. The richness, diversity, composition, and predicted function of the bacterial communities were addressed, as well as the spatiotemporal relationships among P-associated parameters and bacterial communities. Our results showed spatiotemporal variations, highlighting higher values of the temperature, conductivity, nutrients (C, N, P), Pase activity, and Pase genes in sediments collected in sites more anthropogenized during summer. In contrast, higher richness, diversity, and abundance of total bacteria were found in sediments collected in winter. The phylum Proteobacteria and heterotrophy were the most relatively abundant bacterial taxa and predicted function, respectively. The differentiation among winter and summer sediments was also revealed and the relationships between bacterial community and P-associated parameters were confirmed. Our analysis also highlighted the positive relationship between Pase genes with Gemmataceae, Xanthomonadaceae, and Chitinophagaceae families, and between Pase activity and Po with Chromatiaceae and Desulfobacteraceae families. This study represents an initial investigation aimed to unravel the compositions and relationships of bacterial communities with P recycling in these sediments, which are threatened by anthropogenic activity (e.g., agriculture, industry, cities, etc.). This information may be used in the design of countermeasures to prevent deterioration of Chilean rivers, which are relevant as ecosystem service providers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial community; Eutrophication; Phosphomonoesterases; Phosphorus; River sediment","Agricultural robots; Bacteria; Deterioration; Ecosystems; Genes; Phosphorus; Physicochemical properties; Recycling; Rivers; Anthropogenic activity; Anthropogenic influence; Bacterial activity; Bacterial community; Ecosystem services; Phosphomonoesterase; Spatio-temporal relationships; Spatio-temporal variation; Sediments; bacterium; community composition; ester; eutrophication; fluvial deposit; microbial community; phosphorus; spatiotemporal analysis; species diversity; species richness; Chile; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101856040

However, the mechanisms that support these benefits have not been examined in detail. On-farm experiments were conducted in Indonesia during five rice cropping cycles. We compared three monoculture rice systems receiving chemical or organic inputs, and four organic polyculture rice systems that varied in level of complexity. To investigate the agro-ecological mechanisms of weed and pest suppression and nutrient cycling that determine rice productivity and stability, the dynamics of weeds, pests, nutrients and rice yields were monitored and related to rice system complexity. The observations revealed that increasing the level of complexity resulted in lower levels of weed and pest infestation. Analysis of duck behaviour and their gizzard composition showed that ducks foraged intensively on weeds, insects, and snails. Furthermore, nutrient cycling was accelerated by ducks via feeding and excretion as well as by their movement in the field. This could explain why rice yields increased along the gradient of complexity, and overall were higher and less variable in the most complex systems in comparison to the rice monocultures. In complex rice systems, increasing the number of species that are compatible to the rice ecosystems and could play a role in generating ecosystem services of weed and pest suppression as well as nutrient recycling, can lead to higher and less variable rice yields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Analyses of ecological interactions; Duck behaviour; Ecosystem functions; Functional agrobiodiversity; Functional redundancy; Multispecies interactions; Rice yield and stability","agroecology; complexity; crop yield; ecosystem service; excretion; monoculture; polyculture; recycling; rice; weed; Indonesia; Azolla; Gastropoda; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102070297

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that continuous use of biofertilizer to the crops, substituting the use of mineral fertilizer promote C-offset for the soil and generate crop energy efficiency for the production system. Thus, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of biofertilizer use alone or in combination with mineral fertilizer on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation, C-offset, crop energy efficiency and productivity, and alleviation of environmental pollution. The experiment was established in southern Brazil on a soil under 15 years of continuous no-till (NT). Experimental treatments were as follows: i) Control with no fertilizer application, ii) 100% use of industrial mineral fertilizer (Min-F); iii) 100% use of organic waste originated from poultry slaughterhouses and hereinafter designated biofertilizer (Bio-F), and iv) Mixed fertilizer equivalent to the use of 50% mineral fertilizer + 50% of biofertilizer (Mix-F). Effects of experimental treatments were assessed for the crop sequence based on bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), soybean (Glycine max) and corn (Zea mays) in the summer and wheat (Triticum aestivum) and black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) in the winter composing two crops per year, as follow: bean/wheat-soybean/black oat-corn/wheat-soybean/black oat-corn/wheat-bean. The continuous use of Bio-F treatment significantly increased the index of crop energy efficiency. It was higher than that of control, and increased it by 25.4 Mg CO2eq ha−1 over that of Min-F treatment because of higher inputs of crop biomass-C into the system. Further, continuous use of Bio-F resulted in a significantly higher CO2eq stock and offset than those for Min-F treatment. A positive relationship between the C-offset and the crop energy efficiency (R2 = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001) indicated that the increase of C-offset was associated with the increase of energy balance and the amount of SOC sequestered. The higher energy efficiency and C-offset by application of Bio-F indicated that the practice of crop bio fertilization with poultry slaughterhouse waste is a viable alternative for recycling and minimizing the environmental impacts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biofertilizer; Crop productivity; Ecosystem services; Soil organic carbon stock","Agricultural robots; Amino acids; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Fertilizers; Mineral industry; Minerals; Nitrogen fixation; Organic carbon; Pollution; Soils; Wastes; Efficiency increase; Environmental pollutions; Fertilizer applications; Industrial mineral; Mineral fertilizers; Phaseolus vulgaris; Slaughterhouse waste; Soil organic carbon; Energy efficiency; biological product; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; mineral fertilizer; organic carbon; unclassified drug; carbon; nitrogen; biofertilizer; biomass; carbon cycle; ecosystem service; energy efficiency; environmental impact; hypothesis testing; industrial waste; organic pollutant; recycling; soil organic matter; soil pollution; waste management; agro-industrial waste; agroecosystem; Article; Avena strigosa Schreb; biomass production; Brazil; controlled study; crop production; economic efficiency; energy balance; energy crop; environmental impact; hypothesis; maize; no tillage; nonhuman; organic waste; Phaseolus vulgaris; recycling; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; slaughterhouse waste; soil pollution control; soybean; summer; Triticum aestivum; wheat; winter; agriculture; animal; energy conservation; industrial waste; poultry; soil; Brazil; Avena strigosa; Gallus gallus; Glycine max; Phaseolus vulgaris; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agriculture; Animals; Brazil; Carbon; Conservation of Energy Resources; Fertilizers; Industrial Waste; Nitrogen; Poultry; Soil; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100813110

Using a precipitationshed moisture tracking framework, we quantify the contribution sources of evaporation to rainfall in Rondônia in the Brazilian Amazon. Forests account for ∼48% of annual rainfall on average, and more than half of the forest source is from protected areas (PAs). During droughts in 2005 and 2010, moisture supply decreased from oceans and nonforested areas, while supply from forests was stable and compensated for the decrease.

Recalcitrant organic compounds present in soils contaminated with fuel oil can lead to a decrease in functional redundancy within soil microbiomes. Ecopiling is a passive bioremediation technique involving biostimulation of indigenous hydrocarbon degraders, bioaugmentation through inoculation with known petroleum-degrading consortia, and phytoremediation. The current study investigates the assemblage of soil microbial communities and pollutant-degrading potential in soil undergoing the Ecopiling process, through the amplicon marker gene and metagenomics analysis of the contaminated soil. The analysis of key community members including bacteria, fungi, and nematodes revealed a surprisingly diverse microbial community composition within the contaminated soil. The soil bacterial community was found to be dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (60–70%) with the most abundant genera such as Lysobacter, Dietzia, Pseudomonas, and Extensimonas. The fungal community consisted mainly of Ascomycota (50–70% relative abundance). Soil sequencing data allowed the identification of key enzymes involved in the biodegradation of hydrocarbons, providing a novel window into the function of individual bacterial groups in the Ecopile. Although the genus Lysobacter was identified as the most abundant bacterial genus (11–46%) in all of the contaminated soil samples, the metagenomic data were unable to confirm a role for this group in petrochemical degradation.

Quantitative assessments of water-related ecosystem services have traditionally focused on the benefits linked to direct water availability for humans. Under this perspective, forests have been considered as water consumers, due to high interception and transpiration rates that reduce water flows available to downstream human activities. In contrast, their role as water suppliers through transpiration from tree canopies has often been neglected. Integrating this second perspective into assessments of water-related ecosystem services from forests and other land covers is key to providing a comprehensive support to decision-making processes on land-use change. In addition, specific indicators are necessary to incorporate the contribution of the different water balance components into ecosystem service assessment. In this paper, we investigate the use of water balance partitioning for the assessment of water-related ecosystem services. We use three water balance models (two existing ones and one developed in this study) and compare, via model simulations, water balance partitioning and water-related ecosystem services of a forested and a deforested area of the Brazilian State of Rondônia. Then, we propose a set of indicators that, based on the outputs of the models, provide a multidimensional characterization of different land-use types. Regardless of the model used, the values of these indicators for the selected case study consistently point out the key role of vegetation in regulating the water cycle. Forests act as effective indirect water suppliers for human activities and are key players in moisture recycling, thanks to high evapotranspiration rates (about 68% of total precipitation). Deforested areas, instead, act as direct suppliers of water flows for human activities due to higher drainage rates (about 50% of total precipitation). The proposed methodology helps highlight the importance of comprehensive water-related ecosystem services assessments. Moreover, the indicators quantitatively support the impact assessment of land-use change on the different processes involved in the water cycle and on human activities relying, directly or indirectly, on these processes. © 2020 The Author(s)","Deforestation; Ecosystem services indicators; Evapotranspiration; Water balance partitioning; Water-related ecosystem services","Decision making; Deforestation; Evapotranspiration; Flow of water; Hydraulics; Land use; Transpiration; Water recycling; Decision making process; Different land use types; Impact assessments; Quantitative assessments; Total precipitation; Transpiration rates; Water balance components; Water balance models; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096018284

Civic ecology can enhance social-ecological systems; however, their contributions to ecosystem services are rarely measured. We analysed the outcomes of civic ecology interventions undertaken in Durban, South Africa, as part of theWiseWayzWater Care programme (the case study). Using mixed methods (household and beneficiary (community members implementing interventions) surveys, interviews, field observations, and workshops), we identified ecosystem service use and values, as well as the benefits of six interventions (solid waste management and removal from aquatic and terrestrial areas, recycling, invasive alien plant control, river water quality monitoring, vegetable production, and community engagement). Ecosystem services were widely used for agriculture, subsistence, and cultural uses. River water was used for crop irrigation, livestock, and recreation. Respondents noted numerous improvements to natural habitats: decrease in invasive alien plants, less pollution, improved condition of wetlands, and increased production of diverse vegetables. Improved habitats were linked to enhanced ecosystem services: clean water, agricultural production, harvesting of wood, and increased cultural and spiritual activities. Key social benefits were increased social cohesion, education, and new business opportunities. We highlight that local communities can leverage natural capital for well-being and encourage policy support of civic ecology initiatives. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the current structure of the agricultural system works against meeting these expectations. The spatial separation of crop and livestock farms has created negative environmental consequences, and bioenergy production has created a trade-off between food and energy production. In this paper, we explore the opportunities for ecological intensification at a regional scale made possible by combining food and energy production. We built three scenarios representing farming systems including biogas production using grass biomass and manure. These scenarios included the following: (a) The current system with energy production (CSE) from non-edible agricultural biomasses (CSE). (b) Agroecological symbiosis (AES) identical to CSE except with 20% of the arable cropping area converted to clover-grasses for use in biogas production. (c) Agroecological symbiosis with livestock (AES-LST) where the available grass biomass (20% as in the AES) is fed to livestock and manure then used as a feedstock in biogas production. In each scenario, nutrients were circulated back to crops in the form of digestate. The supply of soil functions (primary production for food and energy, provision of nutrient cycling, and climate mitigation) and impacts on water quality through nutrient losses in these three scenarios were then compared to the current system. Integrating biogas production into food production resulted in an increased supply of nutrient recycling, reduced nutrient losses, and increased carbon inputs to the soils indicating enhanced climate mitigation. Food production was either not affected (CSE), increased (AES-LST), or decreased (AES), and biogas was produced in substantial quantities in each scenario. Our study demonstrated potential synergies in integrating food and energy production without compromising other ecosystem services in each scenario. © 2021 The Authors.

Algae can be cultivated independent of arable land and, especially in the case of many microalgae, produce oil- and/or protein-rich biomass with spatial efficiency which far exceeds that of terrestrial plants. Nevertheless, algae and algae-derived products are almost exclusively produced for high-value, low-volume markets and are far from being able to compete with cheap commodities such as plant-based proteins or fossil fuel. High investment and production costs are considered the main reason for this, but a lack of economic incentives for sustainable production and CO2 mitigation should not be overlooked. The development of new production technologies; the monetization of ecosystem services, such as water treatment, CO2 sequestration, and nutrient recycling; as well as the simultaneous production and marketing of “high-value, low-volume” and “low-value, high-volume” products from the same algal biomass are the most promising ways forward. A sustainable “algae industry” could be an integral part of the future bioeconomy, enabling more resource-efficient food and fuel production and creating new products, companies, and jobs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Biofuel; Biomass processing; Circular economy; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Landless food; Microalgae; Nutrients; Seaweed; Wastewater",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099762325

However, large-scale land-use change (LUC) to expand bioenergy crops, such as sugarcane, raises concerns about the potential negative environmental and socioeconomic side effects. Such effects are context-specific, and depending on the LUC scenario and management practices, several co-benefits can be attained. We reviewed the literature and discussed how LUC and best management practices affect key components of sustainability (e.g., soil health, soil carbon (C) sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emissions, nutrient cycling, water quality, among others) of sugarcane-derived bioenergy production in Brazil. Sugarcane expansion has occurred predominantly over pasture areas, although converting croplands could be also an environmentally feasible option. The land transition from low-productivity pastures to sugarcane cultivation seems to be a sustainable pathway to increase bioenergy production. This LUC scenario enhances soil health and soil C sequestration over time, although soil compaction, biodiversity loss, and erosion are still challenging. Besides, adopting best management practices, such as conservation tillage, sustainable crop residue management, rational fertilization, and recycling by-products, has been fundamental to ensuring sustainable bioenergy production. Public policies and well-designed legal frameworks and regulations, such as the Forest Code and the RenovaBio legislations in Brazil, are necessary to make bioenergy production compatible with rational land use and protection. Lastly, our analysis provided insights into sugarcane expansion over a small proportion (1%) of pasture areas in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) and sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, which may result in a substantial impact on global bioenergy supply. We concluded that sugarcane-derived bioenergy is a sustainable option to tackle climate change while provisioning other key ecosystem services and promoting socioeconomic development. © 2021 by the authors.

They are subjected to global changes with a profound impact on the natural range and viability of animal species, the emergence and spatial distribution of pathogens, land use, ecosystem services and farming sustainability. We urgently need to improve our understanding of how animal populations can respond adaptively and therefore sustainably to these new selective pressures. In this context, we explored the common points between animal production science and animal ecology to identify promising avenues of synergy between communities through the transfer of concepts and/or methodologies, focusing on seven concepts that link both disciplines. Animal adaptability, animal diversity (both within and between species), selection, animal management, animal monitoring, agroecology and viability risks were identified as key concepts that should serve the cross-fertilization of both fields to improve ecosystem resilience and farming sustainability. The need for breaking down interdisciplinary barriers is illustrated by two representative examples: i) the circulation and reassortment of pathogens between wild and domestic animals and ii) the role of animals in nutrient cycles, i.e. recycling nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon through, for example, contribution to soil fertility and carbon sequestration. Our synthesis identifies the need for knowledge integration techniques supported by programmes and policy tools that reverse the fragmentation of animal research toward a unification into a single Animal Research Kinship, OneARK, which sets new objectives for future science policy. At the interface of animal ecology and animal production science, our article promotes an effective application of the agroecology concept to animals and the use of functional diversity to increase resilience in both wild and farmed systems. It also promotes the use of novel monitoring technologies to quantify animal welfare and factors affecting fitness. These measures are needed to evaluate viability risk, predict and potentially increase animal adaptability and improve the management of wild and farmed systems, thereby responding to an increasing demand of society for the development of a sustainable management of systems. © 2020","Adaptation; Agroecosystem; Livestock sustainability; Resilience; Zoonotic disease","agricultural land; agriculture; animal; biodiversity; ecology; ecosystem; Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Ecology; Ecosystem; Farms",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100606124

They are an important component of farmland biodiversity considering the numerous functions they perform (e.g. seed dispersal, improving germination, increasing gene flow, nutrient recycling, and pest control). Therefore, their decline imposes substantial risks on agricultural ecosystems. In general, farmland bird conservation includes land-use and management alterations leading to less-intensive farming and land-sparing for breeding habitats (e.g. agri-environment-climate schemes, and organic farming). However, theoretical concepts describing farmland biodiversity maintenance and applied conservation measures usually ignore the role of singular, often very small, natural or man-made elements in an agricultural landscape. These elements play a role in the populations of certain species, their biology and in the general species richness of farmland. Furthermore, the importance of these elements has never been empirically tested, which means that conservationists and practitioners are not aware of their measurable value for birds. Herein, we define and identify singular point elements in the agricultural landscape (SPELs) which are potentially important for breeding farmland birds. We also describe each SPEL and evaluate its importance for birds in farmland based on a systematic review of the available literature. Using a horizon-scanning technique, we then polled field ornithologists about their personal observations of birds in relation to SPELs and the evaluation of the potential roles of such structures for birds. We identified 17 SPELs that vary in naturalness and age: singular trees, singular shrubs, erratic boulders, puddles, electricity pylons, wind turbines, spiritual sites, hunting platforms, fence and border posts, wells, road signs, scarecrows, piles of manure, piles of brushwood/branches, piles of stones/debris, piles of lime, and haystacks. Analysis of the literature revealed knowledge gaps, because some SPELs are frequently mentioned in ecological studies (e.g. trees, shrubs, pylons), but others such as spiritual sites, stones, hunting platforms, wells, road signs, or piles of lime are ignored. Despite the fact that some authors incorporate the effects of some SPELs in their studies, little research to date has aimed to assess the impact of various SPELs on farmland bird species numbers and distribution. Horizon scanning revealed that ornithologists often observe birds on various SPELs and thus, attribute to SPELs many functions that are important for maintaining bird populations. Horizon scanning also highlighted the importance of SPELs for many declining bird species and suggested possible mitigation of negative changes in the agricultural landscape by retaining SPELs within fields. We suggest that a better understanding of the role of SPELs for farmland birds is required. We also recommend that SPELs are considered as a potential tool for the conservation of birds, and existing conservation programs such as agri-environment-climate schemes and organic farming should be updated accordingly. Finally, we suggest that SPELs are included in predictive models that evaluate habitat suitability for farmland biodiversity. © 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society.","agriculture; biodiversity; ecosystem services; farmland; landscape ecology; marginal habitat; novel habitat; point processes; singular elements; small landscape features",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102235720

Among these challenges, it can be highlighted the physical and health damage to the population, interruption of water, energy and food supply services, damage to basic infrastructure, economic losses and contamination of urban rivers. To contribute to the increase of resilience in urban centers, LID practices have been used as a new approach of mitigation and adaptation within urban drainage systems, aiming at runoff retention, peak flow attenuation, pollutant removal and ecosystem services restoration (e.g., resources recycling, carbon sequestration, thermal comfort and landscape integration). These different mitigation purposes and complementary benefits provided by LID practices can be related to the different Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) presented by the United Nations (UN), to achieve countries’ systemic sustainability. The identification of local techniques that contribute to the different SDG helps to achieve their territorialization and application as public policy. Therefore, this paper presents a literature review, categorizing the studies into different generations based on their main application purpose and presents a linkage of the LID benefits to different SDG. Some challenges were identified requiring further investigation, such as the need to identify and quantify the energy demands for LID practices maintenance and their incorporation in the system final energy balance, identification of processes that contribute to carbon sequestration and emission, and risks of emerging pollutants for human health from water reuse and nutrient cycling for sustainable agriculture. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon sequestration; climate change; resilience; stormwater harvesting; water-energy-food nexus","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; Ecosystems; Food supply; Health risks; Losses; Planning; Runoff; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water pollution; Carbon sequestration; Emerging pollutants; Landscape integration; Literature reviews; Low impact development; Resources recycling; Sustainable agriculture; Urban drainage systems; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102180811

Healthy soil availability is the limiting parameter in the provision of a number of these services. As a result of anthropogenic abuses, and natural and global warming-promoted extreme weather events, Planet Earth is currently experiencing an unprecedented crisis of soil deterioration, desertification and erosive loss that increasingly prejudices the services it provides. Such services are pivotal to the Sustainability Development Goals formulated by the United Nations. Immediate and coordinated action on a global scale is urgently required to slow and ultimately reverse the loss of healthy soils. Despite the ‘dirt-dust’, non-vital appearance of soil, it is a highly dynamic living entity, whose life is overwhelmingly microbial. The soil microbiota, which constitutes the greatest reservoir and donor of microbial diversity on Earth, acts as a vast bioreactor, mediating a myriad of chemical reactions that turn the biogeochemical cycles, recycle wastes, purify water, and underpin the multitude of other services soil provides. Fuelling the belowground microbial bioreactor is the aboveground plant and photosynthetic surface microbial life which captures solar energy, fixes inorganic CO2 to organic carbon, and channels fixed carbon and energy into soil. In order to muster an effective response to the crisis, to avoid further deterioration, and to restore unhealthy soils, we need a new and coherent approach, namely to deal with soils worldwide as patients in need of health care and create (i) a public health system for development of effective policies for land use, conservation, restoration, recommendations of prophylactic measures, monitoring and identification of problems (epidemiology), organizing crisis responses, etc., and (ii) a healthcare system charged with soil care: the promotion of good practices, implementation of prophylaxis measures, and institution of therapies for treatment of unhealthy soils and restoration of drylands. These systems need to be national but there is also a desperate need for international coordination. To enable development of effective, evidence-based strategies that will underpin the efforts of soil healthcare systems, a substantial investment in wide-ranging interdisciplinary research on soil health and disease is mandatory. This must lead to a level of understanding of the soil:biota functionalities underlying key ecosystem services that enables formulation of effective diagnosis-prophylaxis-therapy pathways for sustainable use, protection and restoration of different types of soil resources in different climatic zones. These conservation-regenerative-restorative measures need to be complemented by an educative-political-economic-legislative framework that provides incentives encouraging soil care: knowledge, policy, economic and others, and laws which promote international adherence to the principles of restorative soil management. And: we must all be engaged in improving soil health; everyone has a duty of care (https://www.bbc.co.uk/ideas/videos/why-soil-is-one-of-the-most-amazing-things-on-eart/p090cf64).

Because the Linz-Donawitz (LD) slag is rich in silicon (Si) and other fertilizer components, we aim to evaluate the impact of the LD slag amendment on soil quality (by measuring soil physicochemical and biological properties), plant nutrient uptake, and strengthens correlations between nutrient uptake and soil bacterial communities. We used 16 S rRNA illumine sequencing to study soil bacterial community and APIZYM assay to study soil enzymes involved in C, N, and P cycling. The LD slag was applied at 2 Mg ha−1 to Japonica and Indica rice cultivated under flooded conditions. The LD slag amendment significantly improved soil pH, plant photosynthesis, soil nutrient availability, and the crop yield, irrespective of cultivars. It significantly increased N, P, and Si uptake of rice straw. The slag amendment enhanced soil microbial biomass, soil enzyme activities and enriched certain bacterial taxa featuring copiotrophic lifestyles and having the potential role for ecosystem services provided to the benefit of the plant. The study evidenced that the short-term LD slag amendment in rice cropping systems is useful to improve soil physicochemical and biological status, and the crop yield. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"fertilizer; iron; phosphorus; RNA 16S; silicon; steel; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Betaproteobacteria; carbon cycle; chemistry; classification; Deltaproteobacteria; drug effect; Firmicutes; Gammaproteobacteria; genetics; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; metallurgy; microbial consortium; microbiology; nitrogen cycle; Oryza; pH; photosynthesis; physiology; plant root; procedures; soil; waste; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Betaproteobacteria; Carbon Cycle; Deltaproteobacteria; Fertilizers; Firmicutes; Gammaproteobacteria; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Iron; Metallurgy; Microbial Consortia; Nitrogen Cycle; Oryza; Phosphorus; Photosynthesis; Plant Roots; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Silicon; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Steel; Waste Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083785864

Crop residue management is a well-known and widely accepted practice, and is a key component of conservation agriculture. The rapid shift from conventional agriculture to input-intensive modern agricultural practices often leads to an increase in the production of crop residues. Growing more food for an ever-increasing population brings the chance of fast residue generation. Ecosystem services from crop residues improve soil health status and supplement necessary elements in plants. However, this is just one side of the shield. Indecorous crop residue management, including in-situ residue burning, often causes serious environmental hazards. This happens to be one of the most serious environmental hazard issues witnessed by the agricultural sector. Moreover, improper management of these residues often restrains them from imparting their beneficial effects. In this paper, we have reviewed all recent findings to understand and summarize the different aspects of crop residue management, like the impact of the residues on crop and soil health, natural resource recycling, and strategies related to residue retention in farming systems, which are linked to the environment and ecology. This comprehensive review paper may be helpful for different stakeholders to formulate suitable residue management techniques that will fit well under existing farming system practices without compromising the systems’ productivity and environmental sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

Currently, global vision focused on the environmental impact and use of eco-friendly strategies are increasing. The design of new agroecosystems and food systems are fundamental to make more sustainability in soil management systems by improving the release of advanced ecosystems services for farmers. Sustainable agriculture utilizes natural renewable resources in the best way due to their intrinsic features by minimizing harmful impact on the agroecosystems. Farmers should sustain or even increase the soil organic matter (SOM) content overall in depleted, semiarid and arid soils. Nutrients recycled from agro-waste into the soil using residual biomass sources should be endorsed by diversified agriculture and governmental policies in which livestock and crop production are spatially integrated. Many good agricultural practices that growers may use to promote soil quality and soil health by minimizing water use and soil pollution on farms are yet available from past years. Exploration of the natural soil biodiversity and manipulation of soil microbiota by continuous amendment with compost, biochar and digestate represents a pre-requisite to develop more efficient microbial consortia useful for soils and crops. On the other hand, more attention is proven regarding the sustainable use of useful microorganisms employed as pure inoculants in rhizosphere. Among them, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and biological control agents cover the major groups of tailored inoculants in order to rationalize the internal recycling of nutrients and their energy recovery, or to improve the soil quality and plant health thanks to their diversified mechanisms of action and complex interactions between SOM, microbiota and plant roots in the rhizosphere. © 2020 by the author.

This work aims to quantify the carbon sequestration on green roofs from 2012 to 2017 by measuring and calculating parameter on substrate organic carbon and plant organic carbon, when using waste building material substrate (WBMS) as GF substrate for the recycling of waste solid. Green roof group 2 (waste building material substrate (WBMS) as substrate) and green roof group 1 (local natural soil (LNS) as substrate), planting same three native plants (N. auriculata, L. spicata, and L. vicaryi), were both three substrate depth of 20 cm, 25 cm, and 30 cm, respectively. Results show that both innovative WBMS and LNS were a great capability of carbon sequestration and carbon storage on green roofs. Carbon storage of green roof group 1 and green roof group 2 was 65.6 kg C m−2 and 72.6 kg C m−2, respectively. Annual mean carbon sequestration of the WBMS was 1.8 times higher than LNS. The overall average carbon sequestration (12.8 kg C m−2 year−1) in green roof group 2 using WBMS was 1.1 times than corresponding in green roof group 1 (11.4 kg C m−2 year−1 using LNS).

To enhance our understanding of urban sustainability, it is important to investigate how the four types of ES (provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services) are integrated with social, economic, and environmental conditions at the city scale. By adopting the concept of ecosystem service bundles (ESBs), this study investigated how the selected ES indicators were correlated with multiple ESs and clusters of conditions from 1995 to 2015 in Ordos, which is a rapidly growing city in northern China. Pearson's parametric correlation test was used to demonstrate the trade-offs and synergies of ESs. Self-organizing maps were used to delineate ESBs and the condition clusters. Overlap analysis demonstrated the spatial relationships of the six obtained ESBs to reveal the co-occurring clusters of conditions. The provisioning services exhibited trade-offs with regulating and supporting services. Synergies exhibited relationships with regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Out of the six acquired ESBs, the provisioning bundles increased from three to four between 2005 and 2015. In comparison, the regulating bundles decreased from three to one between 1995 and 2015. The extent to which the environmental cluster overlapped with ESBs declined from 63.82% to 50.02% between 2005 and 2015. In comparison, the overlap between the social cluster and ESBs increased from 13.25% to 49.98% during the same period. These two clusters represented the main stressors of multiple ESs in the city. Thus, coal mining, solid waste recycling, and pollution control should be integrated in future decision making. The integrative analysis presented here is expected to help improve the current understanding of urban sustainability by combining spatiotemporal variations in ESBs with the socio-economic-environmental conditions of cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Condition clusters; Ecosystem service bundles; Multiple ecosystem services; Overlap analysis; Urban sustainability","Coal industry; Commerce; Conformal mapping; Decision making; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Pollution control; Self organizing maps; Sustainable development; Dynamic condition; Ecosystem services; Environmental conditions; Integrative analysis; Solid waste recycling; Spatial relationships; Spatio-temporal variation; Urban sustainability; Ecosystems; coal mining; ecosystem service; environmental conditions; pollution control; recycling; socioeconomic impact; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088036448

However, few studies have focused on this process in nutrient-rich ecosystems, especially in eutrophic constructed wetland (CWs). Thus, insight into the nutrient resorption processes of different species in CWs might have important implications for wetland restoration and water purification. Here, we assessed the leaf nitrogen and phosphorus resorption efficiencies and proficiencies of 11 plant species (4 floating and 7 emergent plants) from a CW, and related them to both plant functional traits and environmental variables to develop better predictive power of resorption processes across species. Our results showed that emergent and floating plants, respectively, resorbed 37.4% vs. 8.6% N and 50.1% vs. 23.3% P during nutrient resorption in such a nutrient-rich CW. Green leaf nutrient was the best predictor for the nutrient resorption efficiencies and proficiencies in this CW. Interspecific variation in nutrient resorption defines an important strategy for plant nutrient recycling in nutrient-rich wetland ecosystems, and provide a tool for optimizing the efficiency and timing of nutrient capture via foliage harvesting. This link between wetland plant functions and wetland ecosystem services will thus be beneficial for the nutrient management of CWs in future. © 2019, Society of Wetland Scientists.","Constructed wetlands; Ecosystem services; Nutrient conservation strategy; Nutritional status; Plant functional traits; Wetland plants","constructed wetland; ecosystem service; environmental factor; species richness; wetland management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076601659

In order to understand how the roof ecosystem functions and returns ecosystem services, it is important to study vegetation, soil organisms and runoff quality. We established a vegetated roof experiment based on a substrate containing lightweight crushed concrete, an alkaline side product from a concrete factory, mixed with compost. This five-year experiment in southern Finland tested how planting method (pre-grown vegetation mats vs. pot planting), compost content (20% vs. 40%, fresh volume), and substrate depth affect the cover and diversity of plants, the abundance of soil animals and the quality of runoff. Although the substrate had a high pH (7.3–11.8), many vascular plants were able to survive and establish viable populations. The planting method had a strong effect on plant diversity and the cover of individual species because the vegetation mats became dominated by the invasive, non-native Phedimus hybridus. Establishment with pot plants in turn provided bare ground that was colonised by spontaneous non-invasive species. This resulted in higher diversity, and a more even distribution of species. The amount of compost had only a weak impact on vegetation, whereas high pH generally reduced plant abundance and diversity. The concentrations of total phosphorus and total nitrogen in runoff were low as compared to values reported from many other vegetated roofs, were not affected by compost content and decreased over time. In summary, the high-pH substrate based on recycled materials is an environmentally responsible choice, suitable for a wide variety of plants, even rare and endangered species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Green roof; Nature-based solutions, growth media; Recycled materials; Runoff quality; Vegetation dynamics","Alkalinity; Composting; Concrete industry; Conservation; Forestry; Light weight concrete; Recycling; Roofs; Runoff; Vegetation; Crushed concretes; Ecosystem dynamics; Ecosystem functions; Ecosystem services; Environmentally responsible; Rare and endangered species; Recycled materials; Southern Finland; Ecosystems; abundance; ecosystem dynamics; endangered species; nitrogen; runoff; species diversity; Finland; Animalia; Phedimus hybridus; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088828423

Livestock re-integration into cropland shows potential to improve semi-arid agroecosystem functioning through shifts in biogeochemical processes and the facilitation of multiple ecosystem services involved in carbon and nutrient cycling and use-efficiency. Here we review the characteristics of grazing-based Integrated Crop-Livestock (ICL) systems and how various associated management practices may interplay with semi-arid agroecological and biogeochemical dynamics to influence soil microbial ecology and SOC accumulation and stabilization. We argue that livestock re-integration holds notable potential to increase cropland SOC through controls on landscape net primary productivity, allocation of biomass belowground, efficient recycling of residual crop nutrients, and soil biological activity related to a suite of soil ecosystem services. Achieving the full SOC accumulation potential of ICL management will require site-specific consideration of feedbacks between herbivory, soil microbial ecology, soil disturbance, and forage species interactions. Future research should focus on optimizing plant-soil-grazer feedbacks and understanding of mechanistic drivers of ICL system outcomes to optimize the design and management of semi-arid regional ICL systems for enhanced SOC quality and persistence. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agroecology; Biogeochemistry; Integrated crop-livestock; Plant-soil-grazer interactions; Soil microbial ecology; Soil organic carbon","Bioactivity; Biogeochemistry; Crops; Forestry; Integral equations; Integration; Microbiology; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Soils; Stabilization; Biogeochemical dynamics; Biogeochemical process; Carbon sequestration; Efficient recycling; Management practices; Net primary productivity; Soil biological activity; Soil organic carbon storages; Ecosystems; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; carbon sequestration; microbial activity; microbial ecology; mixed farming; semiarid region; soil ecosystem; soil microorganism; soil organic matter",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089274481

Traditionally, ASCs are terminated through full incorporation into the soil (FI), but alternative termination without tillage is available by roller-crimping (RC). The applicability of RC to Northern and Western European climates has only been studied to a limited extend. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the N dynamics involved in FI and RC of legume and cereal ASCs in organic cabbage production across Northern and Western European climates. Field experiments were conducted at one location in Estonia and in Denmark, and at three locations in Belgium during two cropping cycles (2015/2016 and 2016/2017) to assess the effect of ASC termination method in spring (FI and RC) and ASC species (pea, pea/cereal mixtures and cereals), compared with a bare soil control (BS), on soil mineral N content, N accumulation, yield, and root growth of a following crop of cabbage. Agro-ecological service crops, and in particular cereals, reduced N availability for succeeding cabbage compared with BS by 37–73%. Similar marketable cabbage yield was obtained under FI and BS in two out of four cases in Belgium, due to higher availability of soil mineral N when terminated earlier (April/May) than RC (May/June). However, FI reduced marketable yields by 36–98 % in the other cases in Belgium and in two out of four cases in Estonia and Denmark, where FI was conducted in May/June. Overall, cabbage marketable yields were reduced by 68–100% under RC compared to BS and FI in seven out of nine cases mainly due to reduced soil mineral N availability. Soil mineral N availability was lower under RC likely because of a slower mineralisation of ASCs and soil organic matter. Besides, the termination of ASCs close to the time of cabbage planting under RC increased pre-emptive competition on N. Cabbage marketable yield could be maintained under RC at fertilisation by 236 kg N ha−1 following pea in Denmark. Cabbage root growth was generally increased with higher above ground plant biomass across treatments in Estonia and Denmark, while the relationship was reverse under RC in East Flanders, indicating changes in resource allocation. Soil mineral N at harvest did not differ among treatments in deeper depth, showing no higher risk of N leaching from FI or RC. In conclusion, RC showed major yield reductions in the first and second year after conversion from spring tillage. Therefore, further investigations should verify improved yields under longer-term RC practice, e.g. due to build-up of soil organic matter, before implementation can be recommended in organic vegetable production in Northern and Western Europe. © 2020 The Authors","Brassica oleracea; Cover crops; Incorporation; Organic farming; Roller-crimper; Winter barley; Winter pea; Winter rye","agricultural ecosystem; bare soil; biomass; crop yield; ecosystem service; legume; nitrogen fixation; vegetable; Belgium; Denmark; East Flanders; Estonia; Brassica oleracea; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Hordeum; Pisum sativum; Secale cereale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089275835

Leaves of plants permit the deposition of particulate matter (PM) and, depending on their leaf traits, PM may be immobilized within the epicuticular wax (EW) layer, on trichomes, on hyphae of fungi, or inside stomatal cavities. In this study, leaves of 96 perennial urban plant species consisting of 45 deciduous broadleaf/needle-like trees, 32 deciduous broadleaf shrubs, 12 evergreen needle/scale-like trees, 5 evergreen broadleaf trees, and 2 climber species were investigated in June and September 2016 to determine the effectiveness of distinct leaf surfaces in PM immobilization after leaf washing treatment. The leaf surfaces were washed vigorously using a vortex shaker. The magnetizable component of accumulated and immobilized PM on the leaf surfaces was estimated using saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) of the unwashed and washed leaves, respectively. In June, the washed leaf SIRM of deciduous (broadleaf/needle-like) tree and shrub species (n = 77) ranged between 0.1 and 13.9 μA. In September, the washed leaf SIRM of all investigated plant species (n = 96) ranged between 1.2 and 35.0 μA. Outcomes of this study indicate that leaves of Buddleja davidii, Viburnum lantana, and Sorbus intermedia showed the highest washed leaf SIRM and thus were the most effective in immobilizing PM on their leaf surfaces while leaves of Populus alba, Robinia pseudoacacia, and Abies fraseri with lowest washed leaf SIRM were the least effective. On average, more than half (i.e., 60%) of the magnetic signal still remained after vigorous washing but a large variation exists between species (9–96%). The leaf SIRM of washed leaves of deciduous broadleaf tree and shrub species was significantly higher compared to leaves of evergreen needle/scale-like species. Evidently, the magnetic signal of unwashed leaves was higher than washed ones and higher in September than in June. Leaf traits significantly influenced the magnetic signal of both washed and unwashed leaves: leaves with a high trichome density or high leaf wettability showed a higher unwashed and washed leaf SIRM compared to leaves with no trichomes or low leaf wettability. The effect of epicuticular wax structure types on leaf SIRM was indicated to be only marginally significant. Moreover, also the immobilized fraction of PM was significantly affected by trichome density and leaf wettability, thus substantiating that plant species with high trichome density and/or leaf wettability not only accumulate more PM but are also less prone to PM re-suspension than other species. In general, the results also indicate that leaf SIRM of unwashed leaves can be a good indicator to determine the effectiveness of a plant species in PM immobilization.

Examples of these functions are the recycling of nutrients, the regulation and purification of water, the regulation of the climate, and supporting biodiversity. These abilities are generally referred to as the soil quality. Soil management that favors primary productivity may have positive and negative impacts on the other functions, and vice versa, depending on soil and climatic conditions. All these functions are under pressure, particularly in intensive agriculture. In the absence of mandatory regulations, most European farmers give limited attention to other functions than primary productivity in spite of recommendations by scientists, society and policy makers to acknowledge the ecosystem services provided by soils. The present paper analyses the underlying causes of this limited attention for the multi-functionality of soils by farmers. It is concluded that their focus on primary productivity may stem from (1) insufficient visible proof for soil degradation and benefits of preventive measures over curative measures, (2) limited awareness or conviction of long-term synergies, (3) insufficient remuneration of ecosystem services by society or compensation of yield penalties in favor of these services, (4) lacking trustworthy knowledge about and support for multi-functional soil management, and (5) absence of incentives and regulations on soil management and their enforcement. All these shortcomings need to be addressed by advisors, scientists, and policy makers, whilst acknowledging the need for underpinning and differentiation of incentives and regulations. © Copyright © 2020 Schröder, Ten Berge, Bampa, Creamer, Giraldez-Cervera, Henriksen, Olesen, Rutgers, Sandén and Spiegel.","ecosystem services; land management; primary productivity; soil degradation; soil function; soil health; soil quality",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091916900

Although current management practices may inhibit its expansion, it also impacts not only the quality of water but habitat deterioration. Therefore, the need for developing highly efficient and low-cost biotechnologies with resource recovery into the agriculture field as a complementary management strategy cannot be overstated. Here, we reviewe the scientific/grey literature to offer readers a precise and panoramic view of the invasive watermilfoil ecology, regional problems, impacts, ecosystem services, and management. In this regard, an in-depth review aimed to assess the potential for reducing non-point source inorganic and organic pollutants using invasive watermilfoil, with the sustainable approaches, while offering other services and mitigating ecological trade-offs is presented. Global distributions, growth, and current progress on the management and utilization of invasive watermilfoil biomass are summarized to develop the aim, which is to convey challenges during the implementation of large-scale weed use. In short, pollutant assimilation in plant and bacterial communities linked to this weed considerably contribute to the reduction and degradation of pollutants from both natural and artificial systems. Although several considerations in recycling and reusing biomass need to be considered, the potential reuse of the harvested material for livestock feed, compost and direct use in farming systems offer an additional strategy to achieve sustainable ecosystem restoration. Further research and development may focus on a more detailed economic modeling approach that integrates the costs (worker's wage, harvesting, transportation, and energy consumption), legal and regulatory barriers, health risks and ecosystem service benefits (biodiversity improvement, and pollutant removal) to holistically evaluate the economic, environmental, and societal value of reusing and recycling this waste material. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Invasive plant harvest; Management options; Pollutant remediation; Watermilfoil","biomass; chemical pollutant; ecosystem service; eutrophic environment; invasive species; recycling; restoration ecology; weed; biodiversity; biomass; compost; ecology; ecosystem restoration; energy consumption; farming system; grey literature; health hazard; human; livestock; microbial community; Myriophyllum; nonhuman; reading; recycling; review; worker; agriculture; biomass; ecosystem; pollutant; Bacteria (microorganisms); Myriophyllum; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Biomass; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086426090

The long-term health, productivity, and survival of these canopies rely heavily on the residence time of ecologically-significant materials in these environments. Recent studies have shown that submerged canopies induce a strong mean current over the canopy top, even in purely wave-dominated environments. Thus, in addition to vertical mixing, the horizontal flushing of materials (resulting from these canopy-induced currents) will dictate rates of water renewal and, therefore, residence time in wave-dominated flows over submerged canopies. Building on this recently-improved understanding, this paper provides (for the first time) a framework for estimation of material residence time (Tres) and its variation with core system parameters, including both canopy and wave characteristics. This is done through consideration of a Péclet number (Pe) which is the ratio of mixing to advective time scales. Prediction of residence time for a wide and realistic range of marine canopies (and a correspondingly wide range of Pe) reveals that while Tres decreases with wave height and increases with water depth, it has a complex relationship with canopy density and height. Importantly, residence time can vary from orders of seconds to hours, depending on wave and canopy properties. This has considerable ecological implications for marine canopies through the direct impact on a range of chemical and biogeochemical processes within the canopy. The framework presented here represents a critical step forward in being able to predict residence time in coastal canopies and test the interacting set of factors that influence the residence time in real, complex systems. © Copyright © 2020 Abdolahpour, Ghisalberti, McMahon and Lavery.","biophysical coupling; coastal canopies; ecosystem services; residence time; wave flows",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089999397

Lake Erie's watershed is mostly agricultural, and fertilizers, manure, and drainage practices contribute to high nutrient loads. This study aimed to clarify the role of western Lake Erie sediments in either exacerbating or mitigating conditions that fuel HABs via recycling and/or removal, respectively, of excess N and reactive P. Sediment-water interface N and orthophosphate (ortho-P) dynamics and functional gene analyses of key N transformations were evaluated during a dry, low HAB year (2016) and a wet, high HAB year (2017). On average, western basin sediments were a net N sink and thus perform a valuable ecosystem service via N removal. However, sediments were a source of ortho-P and chemically reduced N. Western basin sediments can theoretically remove 29% of average annual watershed total N loading. Denitrification rates were lower during the high (2017) versus low bloom year (2016), suggesting that high external N loading and large HABs inhibit the capacity of sediments to perform that ecosystem service. Despite being a net N sink on average, western basin sediments released ammonium and urea, chemically reduced N forms that are energetically conducive to non-N-fixing, toxin-producing cyanobacterial HABs, especially during the critical period of low external loading and high biomass. These results support other recent work highlighting the urgent need to include N cycling and internal load dynamics in ecosystem models and mitigation efforts for eutrophic systems. © 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research","Denitrification; Harmful algal blooms; Nitrogen fixation; Nutrients","Agricultural robots; Denitrification; Ecosystems; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Genes; Lakes; Nitrogen fixation; Nutrients; Sediments; Urea; Water recycling; Watersheds; Critical periods; Denitrification rate; Ecosystem services; Functional genes; Harmful algal blooms; N transformation; Nutrient cycling; Sediment water interface; Loading; algal bloom; cyanobacterium; ecosystem service; eutrophication; fertilizer application; gene flow; nitrogen fixation; nutrient cycling; orthophosphate; sediment-water interface; sedimentation; toxin; watershed; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie; algae; Cyanobacteria; Microcystis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084441186

The management of shade trees in a production system is considered an ecosystem-based adaptation practice capable of providing multiple ecosystem services. Objective. Contribute to the understanding of the effects of trees in coffee plantations on ecosystem services for provisioning and regulation and how the analysis of relationships between services can contribute to improve the design and management of these systems. Development. The study was carried out between July and October 2017. Shade trees have an effect on coffee yield, attributed to their influence on the regulation of fruit load. This effect can have positive results with an adequate agroforestry management, as it would reduce extreme biennial fluctuations in coffee production. The trees also regulate the climate within the coffee plantation (microclimate), in addition, they have positive effects on soil fertility, the amount of organic matter, the recycling of nutrients, decrease soil evaporation, reduce erosion and sequester carbon. However, there are some aspects that are still complex and sometimes contradictory. Overall, the documentation of the positive aspects of the trees on provisioning and regulation services is greater than the negative ones. Conclusion. This review shows an effect of shade trees on ecosystem services. Knowledge of these effects, considering the interest and expectations of the social systems, must be complemented with analysis of relationships between services with the aim to identifying best agroforestry practices or model systems that can provide multiple services simultaneously. © 2020 Agronomía Mesoamericana es desarrollada en la Universidad de Costa Rica bajo una licencia Creative Commons Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivar 4.0 Internacional.","Agroforestry; Coffea; Multipurpose trees",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093898684

Identifying priorities necessary to engage grand challenges can be facilitated through horizon scanning exercises, and to this end we identified and examined 23 priority research questions needed to advance toward more sustainable environmental quality in Asia, as part of the Global Horizon Scanning Project. Advances in environmental toxicology, environmental chemistry, biological monitoring, and risk-assessment methodologies are necessary to address the adverse impacts of environmental stressors on ecosystem services and biodiversity, with Asia being home to numerous biodiversity hotspots. Intersections of the food–energy–water nexus are profound in Asia; innovative and aggressive technologies are necessary to provide clean water, ensure food safety, and stimulate energy efficiency, while improving ecological integrity and addressing legacy and emerging threats to public health and the environment, particularly with increased aquaculture production. Asia is the largest chemical-producing continent globally. Accordingly, sustainable and green chemistry and engineering present decided opportunities to stimulate innovation and realize a number of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Engaging the priority research questions identified herein will require transdisciplinary coordination through existing and nontraditional partnerships within and among countries and sectors. Answering these questions will not be easy but is necessary to achieve more sustainable environmental quality in Asia. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:1485–1505. © 2020 The Authors.

Large herbivore dung and its decomposition has so far been characterized by stoichiometric analyses of elements such as C and N. The objective of our study was to examine the suitability of biomarker analyses and analytical pyrolysis to infer large herbivore feeding behavior and the decomposition of their dung in different environments. Our conceptual approach included exposure of fresh dung of a grazing ruminant (gaur, Bos gaurus) and a non-ruminant mixed-feeder (the Asian elephant, Elephas maximus) in two tropical forest types (dry and moist) and analysis of dung biochemical composition in two seasons (dry and wet). To this end we characterized the dungs’ lignin and carbohydrate (sugar) signatures and pyrolysis products before and after 28 days of exposure. Our results showed that stoichiometric as well as biomarker analyses were able to differentiate gaur and elephant dung independent of season and forest type, while analytical pyrolysis products did not differ between dung types. The lignin signature of fresh dung additionally indicated the forage preference of animals in different forest types and seasons. During decomposition, C and N contents decreased and the chemical composition of both dung types converged. The lignin signature of dung at the end of the experiment showed higher lignin decomposition in moist forest and wet season than dry forest and dry season. We conclude that detailed biochemical analyses can provide deeper insights into the main controls of large herbivore dung and its decomposition in tropical forests than stoichiometric analysis. In particular lignin may be a suitable indicator to investigate large herbivore feeding behavior and the environmental conditions of their habitat. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon cycling; Dung decomposition; Ecosystem services; Large herbivore ecology; Lignin; Tropical forest","Animals; Biomarkers; Feeding; Indicators (chemical); Lignin; Pyrolysis; Tropics; Analytical pyrolysis; Biochemical analysis; Biochemical composition; Chemical compositions; Conceptual approaches; Decomposition process; Environmental conditions; Environmental factors; Forestry; biochemical composition; biomarker; carbon; decomposition; elephant; environmental factor; feces; feeding behavior; herbivory; nitrogen; pyrolysis; recycling; stoichiometry; tropical forest; Animals; Feeding; Forestry; Pyrolysis; Tropics; Animalia; Bos gaurus; Elephas maximus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083880847

Unprecedented and continuous accumulation of growing plastic contaminants into any respective aquatic ecosystem by the anthropogenic sources causes direct and/or indirect interruption to ecosystem structure, functions, and consequently, services and values. Land-based and sea-based sources are the primary sources of these contaminants in various modes that enter the ocean. In this review paper, we focused on highlighting different aspects related to plastic pollution in coastal and marine environments. Plastic pollutants are distributed in the ecosystems in different forms, with different size variations as megaplastic, macroplastic, mesoplastic, and microplastic. Microplastics in primary and secondary forms reveal a widespread distribution in the water, sediment, and biota of the marine and coastal habitats. The microplastic level of different coastal and marine ecosystems nearly ranged from 0.001-140 particles/m3 in water and 0.2-8766 particles/m3 in sediments at different aquatic environments over the world. The microplastic accumulation rate of coastal and marine organisms varied at 0.1-15,033 counts. Accordingly, plastic pollution creates several kinds of negative consequences combined with ecological and socio-economic effects. Entanglement, toxicological effects via ingestion of plastics, suffocation, starvation, dispersal, and rafting of organisms, provision of new habitats, and introduction of invasive species are significant ecological effects with growing threats to biodiversity and trophic relationships. Degradation (changes in the ecosystem state) and modifications of marine systems are associated with loss of ecosystem services and values. Consequently, this emerging contaminant affects the socio-economic aspects through negative impacts on tourism, fishery, shipping, and human health. Preventing accumulation sources of plastic pollutants, 3Rs (Reduce-Recycle-Reuse), awareness &amp; capacity building, and producer/manufacturer responsibility are practical approaches toward addressing the issue of plastic pollution. Existing and adopted policies, legislations, regulations, and initiatives at global, regional, and national level play a vital role in reducing plastic debris in the marine and coastal zones. Development of proposals/solutions on key research gaps can open a novel pathway to address this environmental issue in an effective scientific manner. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the current status of plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem to make aware people of a plastic-free, healthy blue ocean in the near future. © 2020 The Author(s)","Aquatic ecology; Ecological health; Ecological restoration; Environmental analysis; Environmental assessment; Environmental hazard; Environmental health; Environmental management; Hydrology; Marine biology; Microplastics; Oceanography; Plastic sources; Pollution; Producer responsibility",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089847165

The cores for the promotion of healthy soils are; eliminating the limiting factors of soils; increasing the content of soil organic carbon and nutrient use efficiency; exploiting the biological potentials; promoting synergistic interactions between above-ground and below-ground. The aim of soil health engineering is to synergize the production and other ecosystem services delivered by soils by optimizing the internal regulatory processes whilst minimizing the external inputs. The cultivation of healthy soil needs holistic engineering, which requires comprehensive integration of whole industry chain in the nexus of external input, crop production, products-processing, and waste recycling. Meanwhile, cross-disciplinary innovation, government-farmer-research-extension institute collaboration, and policy support and incentive systems are crucial for realizing soil health towards AGD. © 2020 Science Press.

However, variations in microclimate and decomposers among studies have impeded a mechanistic understanding of what controls litter decomposition. We conducted a “common plot” experiment leveling-off impacts of environmental and biotic factors to explore roles of the initial leaf litter traits in decomposition. Methods: The experiment was carried out in an evergreen broadleaf forest in the Wuyi Mountains from May 2017 to August 2018. Leaf litter was collected from Populus deltoids in a nitrogen (N) addition experiment at Dongtai Forest Farm, Liriodendron chinense × tulipifera and Platanus acerifolia on campus Nanjing Forestry University, and Quercus variabilis and Pinus taeda at Xiashu Forest Farm. Results: Our results showed that N addition significantly increased leaf litter decomposition of P. deltoids. This may result from N induced increases in litter quality, indicated by a high N content and a low C:N ratio of leaf litter. Across the five tree species (with no litter from P. deltoids under N addition treatment), we found litter decomposition of the coniferous tree (P. taeda) was much lower than that of the other four broadleaf trees due to its lower litter quality. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the initial C:N ratio and sodium (Na) content that was critical for decomposers dominated decomposition. Conclusions: Our results confirmed the importance of the initial litter quality, such as C:N ratio, in regulating leaf litter decomposition. In addition, our results suggest the Na control of the decomposition of leaf litter in subtropical ecosystems through Na limiting the activity and abundance of decomposers in brown food webs. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","C:N ratio, Na content; Decomposition of leaf litter; Leaf litter quality; Nitrogen deposition; Subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest","broad-leaved forest; coniferous tree; decomposition; evergreen forest; leaf litter; microclimate; nutrient cycling; relative abundance; soil biota; soil-vegetation interaction; subtropical region; China; Dongtai; Fujian; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Wuyi Mountain; Coniferales; Liriodendron chinense; Pinus taeda; Platanus x acerifolia; Populus; Quercus variabilis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085284935

A completely randomized experiment was designed with four treatments and three replications: PM- monoculture with 30 prawn m−2, FM- monoculture with 3 fish m−2, IMTA- fish-prawn polyculture with 30 prawn m−2 and 3 fish m−2 reared free-swimming, POLY-CAGE- fish-prawn IMTA with 30 prawn m−2 reared free-swimming and 40 fish m−3 in net-cages. Animals, rain, water, feed, soil, gases, total suspended solids, settleable solids, and accumulated sludge were collected throughout the experiment to determine their total organic and total inorganic carbon contents and to calculate the carbon budget. Results showed that much of the carbon accumulated as solid organic material (∼55 – 84%) and animal biomass (∼4 – 18%). The remaining carbon was discharged to receiving water bodies in the outlet water during harvesting (∼6 – 8%) or emitted as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) (∼1 – 5%). Feed management appeared to influence the major biological processes in the aquatic carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and aerobic decomposition. All systems showed absorption of atmospheric CO2 (∼529 – 782 kg C-CO2 ha−1) that was higher than the emissions (∼35 – 93 kg C-CO2 ha−1) and CH4 (∼14 – 123 kg C-CH4 ha−1). Furthermore, all of the culture processes in the present study removed ∼1,000 to 2,000 kg Total Carbon ha−1 from the inlet water, and thus, these systems can provide important ecosystem services. The high accumulation of carbon in the settleable solids (∼69% of outputs) and the adequate water quality maintained in the IMTA demonstrate the resilience of this grow-out system to high allochthonous inputs of organic matter as feed. An increased prawn density or the addition of a mud-feeder species to the culture may enhance the incorporation of carbon from settleable solids into harvested biomass, improving the efficiency of the systems. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon; carbon sequestration; IMTA; in ponds; Macrobrachium Colossoma",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083796751

The saturation is spreading to the edge-of-the-farm stormwater detention systems (SDSs) from where the legacy P is potentially being released to downstream surface waters. We use site-specific and literature data for P-saturated SDSs, to develop and evaluate the biogeochemical and economic feasibility of a P recycling program that targets both low (LIC, sugarcane) and high intensity cropping (HIC, fresh-produce) systems within a watershed. The focus is to close the P cycle loop to rejuvenate P sink function of SDSs. It involves harvesting and composting the SDS's biomass and it's on-farm use as an organic fertilizer for crops. Results showed that harvesting-composting can conservatively increase the P retention from 50% to 77% for HIC and almost complete treatment for LIC. Beyond potentially increasing yield and improving soil health, compost use can further increase in-field retention of P (and water). Additional costs incurred in harvesting and composting can be offset by the economic value of compost and the reduction in State's expenditure on regional P treatment systems. Treatment costs were $26/kg of P for HIC and $42/kg for LIC, 10 times less than the current state expenditure of $355–$909/kg P using constructed wetlands. We propose an incentivized, payment for services (PS) program, where producers are paid for P recycling. The PS program considers the intensity of cropping systems and their location along the drainage network from headwaters to the outlet, to achieve basin-scale P load reduction. The LIC SDSs recover regional P by passing the public water through them while recycling is implemented at the HIC. The estimated basin-scale P retention with harvest-compost approach was 854 metric tons, 5 times the P that entered the Everglades Protection Area in 2018, at 88%–93% less cost than the State treatment systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Legacy phosphorus; Payment for ecosystem services; Phytoremediation; Recycling; Stormwater detention; Water quality; Watershed management","Beryllium compounds; Bioremediation; Catchments; Composting; Convolution; Economic analysis; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Harvesting; Hybrid integrated circuits; Legacy systems; Phosphorus; Recycling; Reduction; Soil conservation; Storms; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Water recycling; Watersheds; Wetlands; Agricultural soils; Constructed wetlands; Economic feasibilities; Ecosystem services; Organic fertilizers; Phytoremediation; Storm water detention; Watershed management; Costs; carbon; hydrogen; organic fertilizer; phosphorus; storm water; surface water; fertilizer; phosphorus; biomass; composting; ecosystem service; fertilizer; phosphorus; phytoremediation; recycling; stormwater; water quality; watershed; adoption; Article; biogeochemistry; biomass; compost; composting; cropping system; dispersion; economic aspect; environmental health; environmental protection; feasibility study; financial management; harvesting; priority journal; recycling; sugarcane; water management; water pollution; watershed; agricultural land; agriculture; biomass; pond; soil; Everglades; Florida [United States]; United States; Agriculture; Biomass; Farms; Fertilizers; Phosphorus; Ponds; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080985307

Direct consumption of organic matter by the saprophagous larvae provides the ecosystem with a fundamental service by recycling nutrients and reducing exposure to decomposing matter. The present study aimed to assess the functional role of saprophagous flies in the mass loss of different types of decomposing organic matter. 2. Two types of common urban waste were used to measure the role of flies in reducing organic matter: chicken viscera (chicken) and a mixture of flour and uncooked eggs (flour and eggs), representing leftover food. Ten traps baited with each substrate, under field conditions, allowed fly access (exposed to flies) and three traps from each substrate did not (unexposed controls); adult flies entering the traps or emerging from the substrates and substrate mass loss were recorded. 3. Species from Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae, Muscidae, and Fanniidae families were collected mainly in traps baited with chicken, with Phoridae being the most abundant in traps with flour and eggs as bait. A significantly richer (P ' 0.05) assemblage of fly species accessed the traps baited with chicken viscera (21 species) compared with those emerging (11 species), whereas similar numbers of species accessed (n = 5) or emerged (n = 1) from traps baited with flour and eggs (average richness accessing 7.97, emerging 2.83). Chicken substrate mass loss and species richness were positively related (r = 0.56, P = 0.001). In traps where richness was larger than 10 species, the substrates were reduced by more than 85% of their initial weight compared with unexposed controls, which lost 30%. Substrate mass loss significantly increased with the abundance of flies (r = 0.73, P ' 0.0001). 4. The results of the present study support the functional role of saprophagous species diversity on the decomposition rates of organic matter, reinforcing the negative consequences of loss or gain of species in modified landscapes and for ecosystem function. © 2020 The Royal Entomological Society","Biodiversity; ecological processes; flies; urban ecosystem services; urban waste","abundance; biodiversity; ecosystem service; fly; functional role; landscape ecology; species diversity; species richness; urban ecosystem; Calliphoridae; Fanniidae; Muscidae; Phoridae; Sarcophagidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079030554

To date, a diversification option that has received little attention is introduction of ley pastures into cropping systems, but the use of ley pastures is challenged by most future-oriented scenarios aiming to feed the world sustainably. In these scenarios, ruminant livestock feed only on permanent pastures, while cropping systems focus completely on production of crop-based human food. Diversification of cropping systems with ley pastures is thus compromised by knowledge gaps and future-oriented policy options. Here, we review ecosystem services provided by introducing ley pastures into cropping systems to increase sustainability of agriculture, discuss types of ley pastures and their management liable to promote these services, and raise future challenges related to introducing ley pastures into cropping systems. We conclude that (1) ley pastures provide a large set of input (soil conservation, nutrient provision and recycling, soil water retention, biological control of pests) and output (water purification, climate regulation, habitat provision for biodiversity conservation, forage production) ecosystem services of primary importance to cropping systems and society, respectively, as long as their spatial and temporal insertion within cropping systems is well-managed; otherwise, disservices may be produced. (2) To benefit from ecosystem services provided by ley pastures in cropping systems while limiting their disservices, it appears necessary to define a safe operating space for ley pastures in cropping systems. Moving towards this space requires changing plant breeding programs towards multiservice ley pastures, producing knowledge about emerging ways of introducing ley pastures into cropping systems (e.g., living mulch, green manure) and better quantifying the bundles of ecosystem services provided by ley pastures in cropping systems. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cropping systems; Ecosystem services; Ley pastures; Scenarios; Sown grasslands","agricultural management; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; biological control; cropping practice; ecosystem service; food production; pasture; plant breeding; soil water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084491752

Soil health is closely associated with sustainable agriculture, because soil microorganism diversity and activity are the main components of soil health. Agricultural sustainability is defined as the ability of a crop production system to continuously produce food without environmental degradation. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), cyanobacteria, and beneficial nematodes enhance water use efficiency and nutrient availability to plants, phytohormones production, soil nutrient cycling, and plant resistance to environmental stresses. Farming practices have shown that organic farming and tillage improve soil health by increasing the abundance, diversity, and activity of microorganisms. Conservation tillage can potentially increase grower's profitability by reducing inputs and labor costs as compared to conventional tillage while organic farming might add extra management costs due to high labor demands for weeding and pest control, and for fertilizer inputs (particularly N-based), which typically have less consistent uniformity and stability than synthetic fertilizers. This review will discuss the external factors controlling the abundance of rhizosphere microbiota and the impact of crop management practices on soil health and their role in sustainable crop production. © 2020 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Cyanobacteria; Microbes; Mycorrhizal fungi; Nematodes; Organic farming; Soil tillage","agricultural management; alternative agriculture; arbuscular mycorrhiza; decomposition analysis; ecosystem health; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; fungus; management practice; nutrient cycling; soil microorganism; soil nutrient; species diversity; water quality; Cyanobacteria; Fungi; Nematoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087482099

The objective of the paper is to analyse the links between the EU bioeconomy strategy and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to assess what could be the main points of synergies and tensions between bioeconomy-related SDG targets. By semantically mapping the action plan of the 2018 EU bioeconomy strategy with the SDG targets, the paper finds that the bioeconomy strategy is aligned with 53 targets distributed in 12 of the 17 SDGs. Ex-post correlation analysis on bioeconomy-related SDGs indicators for 28 EU Member States (1990–2018) shows a predominance of synergies over trade-offs. More intense synergetic past developments (positive correlations) are found among clean energies (SDG 7), recycling (SDG 11), ecosystem preservation (SDG 15) and most of all other bioeconomy-related SDGs. Negative correlations are observed between agro-biodiversity (SDG 2), domestic material consumption of biomass (SDG 8 and 12), agriculture and industrial developments (SDG 2 and SDG 9) and a wide array of bioeconomy-related SDG indicators. The hotspots of strong correlations identified might be useful in further enrichment of ex-ante simulation models. From a policy coherence perspective, a wide range of policy instruments are already in place in the EU to foster synergies and may bring co-benefits. Policies oriented at preventing trade-offs are already in place but they have not overcome the antagonisms observed in this study yet. Change in practices, technical and technological innovations and the application of circular and ‘cascading principles’ are the most common fields of action. © 2020 The Authors","Bioeconomy; Biomass; Correlation; Policy coherence; SDG","Biodiversity; Biomass; Correlation methods; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; International trade; Sustainable development; Bioeconomy; Correlation analysis; Ecosystem services; Industrial development; Negative correlation; Policy instruments; Positive correlations; Technological innovation; Planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077928234

New forms of urban agriculture are observed such as rooftop farming. In the case of low-tech rooftop farming projects, based on recycled urban waste, one of the key issues is the type of substrate used, as it determines the functions and ecosystem services delivered by the green roof. Using a five year experimental trial, we quantified the food production potential of Technosols created only with urban wastes (green waste compost, crushed wood, spent mushroom), as well as the soil fertility and the potential contamination of food products. Regarding food production, our cropping system showed promising results across the five years, in relation with the high fertility of the Technosols. This fertility was maintained, as well as the nutrients stocks after five cropping years. Most of the edible crops had trace metals contents below existing norms for toxic trace metals with nevertheless a concern regarding certain some trace metals such as Zn and Cu. There was no trace metal accumulation in the Technosols over time except for Zn. This study confirmed that constructing Technosols only from urban wastes is a suitable and efficient solution to design rooftops for edible production. © 2020 by the authors.

The root cause (‘driver’) of deteriorating water quality is rapid population growth that leads to increasing inputs from wastewater treatment works (WWTWs), stormwater run-off and agricultural return flow (‘pressures’). Nationally, half of the country’s estuaries are affected by nutrient pollution (‘state’). This has elicited marked primary producer and secondary (hypoxia, fish kills, loss of ecosystem services) responses (‘impact’). The Sundays and Swartkops Estuaries are eutrophic with phytoplankton blooms (>20 µg l−1) and bottom-water hypoxia. Similarly, the nationally important Knysna Estuary experiences eutrophic conditions associated with macroalgal blooms, whereas the Wildevoëlvlei and Zeekoe systems have transitioned to alternate stable states characterised by toxic cyanobacteria blooms, as a result of WWTW inputs and increased water residence times. The health of the St Lucia Estuary, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is under threat from agricultural inputs from the uMfolozi system. Nationally, better treatment and recycling of WWTW inputs is required to improve and restore estuary health. Owing to excessive WWTW effluent volumes, treatment to South Africa’s uniform effluent standards no longer prevent eutrophication. Other urgent interventions needed are compliance monitoring, engineering solutions to reduce stormwater and wastewater input, and prudent application of agricultural fertilisers. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Better coordination of material exchanges at the local scale can facilitate more efficient resource use. Here, we present a new agent-based model, “Flows in Agro-food Networks” (FAN), which simulates the processing and exchange of fertilizers, feed, food and wastes among farms and multiple upstream or downstream partners (feed and fertilizer suppliers, food industries, waste processors, and anaerobic digesters) in small farming regions. FAN includes a series of environmental indicators that can be used to assess alternative scenarios in terms of ecosystem services, nutrient cycling, and resource autonomy. We use a French case study to demonstrate FAN's dynamics and to explore the sensitivity of key parameters.

The management of earthworms in non-flooded rice fields appears to be a promising strategy to support residue recycling and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions triggered by residue amendment. We conducted a field experiment on non-flooded rainfed rice fields, with and without residue amendment. In-situ mesocosms were inoculated with endogeic earthworms (Metaphire sp.), with either low (ET1: 150 individuals m− 2), or high density (ET2: 450 individuals m− 2), and a control (ET0: no earthworms). We measured GHG emissions (methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); carbon dioxide (CO2)) twice a week during the cropping season with static chambers. Effects of earthworms on yield and root growth were additionally assessed. Earthworms offset the enormous increase of CH4 emissions induced by straw amendment (from 4.6 ± 5 to 75.3 ± 46 kg CH4-C ha− 1 in ET0). Earthworm activity significantly reduced CH4 release, particularly at ET2, by more than one-third (to 22 ± 15 kg CH4-C ha− 1). In contrast, earthworm inoculation did not affect N2O emission. Straw amendment more than doubled the global warming potential (GWP). Earthworms reduced GWP by 39% at low (ET1) and 55% at high densities (ET2). Earthworm activity reduced root mass density under conditions of straw amendment but did not affect yield. Earthworms can significantly reduce detrimental effects of rice crop residue amendment on GHG release under upland rice production. Organic carbon (C) might be preserved in earthworm casts and thereby limit C availability for CH4 production. At the same time, earthworm activity might increase methanotrophic CH4 consumption, due to improved soil aeration or less root exudates. Consequently, earthworms have a strong potential for regulating ecosystem functions related to rice straw decomposition, nutrient allocation and thus GHG reduction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aerobic rice; Bioturbation; Ecosystem services; Global warming potential; Residue decomposition; Soil fauna","Agricultural wastes; Animals; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Economics; Ecosystems; Floods; Gas emissions; Global warming; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Aerobic rice; Bioturbation; Ecosystem services; Global warming potential; Residue decomposition; Soil fauna; Greenhouse gases; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; aeration; crop production; crop yield; decomposition; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; greenhouse gas; mesocosm; rainfed agriculture; rice; soil amendment; soil fauna; straw; aeration; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; cropping system; global warming potential; greenhouse effect; inoculation; litter decomposition; mesocosm; Metaphire; plant root; priority journal; rice; root growth; root mass; seasonal variation; soil aeration; soil analysis; agriculture; animal; Asia; greenhouse gas; Oligochaeta; Oryza; soil; Asia; earthworms (sp.); Metaphire; Agriculture; Animals; Asia; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Oligochaeta; Oryza; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077502361

It is estimated that more than five billion people will be located in urban areas by 2030. Many projects have been initiated in the megacities to support the new ecosystem services in providing the most sustainable and efficient food supply solutions, as well as for transporting fresh and clean vegetables. One of the most important focus areas is research on energy sustainability, including how to optimize energy efficiency to meet the needs of citizens and companies. Indoor urban vertical farming (IUVF) is one of the greatest achievements of our time in agriculture, as it is entirely focused on meeting the food needs of people living in urban areas with the lowest environmental and energy costs. IUVF creates a new foundation in the urban food production system, providing opportunities for many other sustainable activities, such as energy and grey water recycling, but beyond all, it helps citizens to have access in fresh and nutritious fruits and vegetables and to become more creative building up their skills regarding sustainable food production. In this study, the internal rate of return (IRR) and the net present value (NPV) indexes were used to compare IUVF and greenhouse (GH) facilities under various financing schemes. Consistent with similar studies, this research also confirms that IUVF is much more profitable for investors, saving significant resources compared to GHs. © 2020 by the authors.","Cash flow analysis; Greenhouses; Production economics; Vertical farming","agricultural economics; business development; ecosystem service; energy efficiency; farming system; food production; food supply; greenhouse ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082576469

However, their environmental performances have not been fully understood from a life-cycle perspective. In this study, we evaluated the life-cycle environmental performances and energy efficiencies of three types of green infrastructure, i.e. green roof, greenway, and grove that are increasingly built in cities. Our analysis covered all phases of the life-cycle including extraction and construction, use and maintenance, end-of-life, and transportation. Results confirm the environmental improvements of the green roof, greenway, and grove in most of the addressed impact categories. The energy saving in the use and maintenance phase contributed a significant part to these improvements, while the construction material in the extraction and construction phase had a dominant share in the environmental impacts. The grove and greenway showed better environmental performances than the green roof. The extensive use of compost for the greenway and grove could release toxic substances to the environment, and offset environmental improvements or even resulted in a negative consequence to EP of the greenway. The utilization of substrate and waste disposal for the green roof caused relatively high impacts on the environment. Sensitivity analysis shows a 50% reduction of the energy saving weakened the environmental improvements of the green roof, greenway and grove in all categories, and particularly exacerbated the environmental impacts on EP and CADP for the green roof, AP for the greenway and EP for the grove; and an increased waste recycling and reuse rates will greatly enhance the environmental improvements of the green roof. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cradle-to-Grave; Energy saving; Green roof; Greenway; Grove","Artificial life; Composting; Ecosystems; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Extraction; Roofs; Sensitivity analysis; Waste disposal; Cradle-to-Grave; Environmental improvements; Environmental performance; Green roof; Greenways; Grove; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Utilization of substrate; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075477898

Optimization of wastewater treatment processes could reduce capital expenditures, lowering the barrier to market entry for lignocellulosic biorefineries. This paper characterizes wastewater associated with lignocellulosic ethanol production and evaluates potential wastewater treatment operations. Results: It is found that organic material is intrinsic to bioconversion wastewater, representing up to 260 kg of biological oxygen demand per tonne of feedstock processed. Inorganics in the wastewater largely originate from additions during pretreatment and pH adjustments, which increase the inorganic loading by 44 kg per tonne of feedstock processed. Adjusting the ethanol production process to decrease addition of inorganic material could reduce the demands and therefore cost of waste treatment. Various waste treatment technologies - including those that take advantage of ecosystem services provided by feedstock production - were compared in terms of capital and operating costs, as well as technical feasibility. Conclusions: It is concluded that wastewater treatment technologies should be better integrated with conversion process design and feedstock production.

Therefore, tropical agriculture is highly dependent on ecosystem services, such as nutrient recycling and carbon sequestration, to enhance soil fertility, increase nutrient uptake, and facilitate sustainable production of agricultural goods. This research aimed to find the balance between sustainability and profitability of tropical agriculture by evaluating the changes in soil caused by the ecosystem services provided by the biomass of leguminous trees (Gliricidia) and assessing how these changes (associated with potassium) can affect nitrogen-use efficiency and maize yield. An experiment was conducted testing the impact of Glircidia biomass addition vs. bare soil, with or without addition of both nitrogen and/or potassium. Changes in soil organic matter, (SOM) base cations sum, soil resistance, N uptake, N-use efficiency, and maize yield were evaluated. Gliricidia biomass, when used with N and K, contributed to increasing SOM by 5.0 g/kg and the sum of base cations by 1458. 65 kg/ha in the 0–30 cm layer. Moreover, grain yield was increased by approximately 70% in the treatments with Gliricidia when compared to treatments without biomass where yield was very low. In bare soil, the additional yield of 1.5 tons/ha would not be enough to convince farmers to change slash and burn to conventional bare soil systems. Our results showed that leguminous trees, such as Gliricidia, might contribute to ensuring sustainable agricultural intensification in humid tropical soils with low natural fertility by providing ecosystem services such as biomass production, carbon sequestration, base cation recycling, and increased N acquisition. These findings might be an important strategy to replace the common slash-and-burn-system and preserve the rainforest against the traditional shifting cultivation system. In contrast, the conventional system with bare soil showed that the addition of nitrogen was unfeasible, mainly in conditions of high rainfall precipitation. In these circumstances, the use of potassium may increase nitrogen-use efficiency only when biomass is not used. © 2020 The Authors.","nutrients recycling; soil organic matter; soil rootability; sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080980769

These environments may be considered as biofilters, able to regulate the transport and transformation of OM from land to sea and vice-versa, due to the porous structure of the sediment and the colonisation by microorganisms. The efficiency of OM recycling performed by enzymatic activities (EAs) was evaluated in three beaches of the NW Mediterranean Sea, characterised by different anthropogenic pressure (urbanisation), and morphodynamic characteristics (exposition to waves). The sampling was focused on the area that includes the swash zone and the wet emerged beach. Urbanisation significantly influenced EAs, leading to a decoupling between the lipolytic EAs and the lipid content of sediment. Natural and anthropogenic lipids, showing higher turnover times than other OM (proteins), accumulated in the sediment, notwithstanding the very high lipolytic activities. In the sheltered side of the urbanised sites, significant correlations between EAs, sedimentary OM and seawater inorganic nutrients were recorded, confirming the biofilter activity. In the exposed sites, the wave action increased the exchanges with the sea by water flushing inside the sediment, and EAs were related mainly to salinity. Especially in the least urbanised beach, coarse texture, higher pendency and heterogeneity of the sediment decreased the biofilter activity, allowing photosynthetic producers to increase their biomass. In this case, the beach hosted production of fresh OM, contributing to fulfil the trophic web requirements. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"anthropogenic effect; beach; biofiltration; ecosystem service; enzyme activity; heterogeneity; land-sea interaction; morphodynamics; oligotrophic environment; organic matter; recycling; sand; sediment pollution; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077626080

However, conventional biophysical and economic indicators hardly fit CE characteristics. Life cycle assessment, footprint and economic cost-benefit indicators, do not fully capture the specificity of a closed loop CE framework, characterized by feedbacks and resource use minimization and quality assessment. Commonly used mono-dimensional indicators seem unable to successfully relate the process performance and the use of ecosystem services and natural capital, in that they do not assess the environmental quality and sustainability (renewability, fit to use, recycle potential) of resources and the complexity of interaction between agro/industrial/urban environments and socioeconomic systems, and translate into an incomplete and inadequate picture, far from an effective CE perspective. In this study, Emergy Accounting method (EMA) is used to design an improved approach to CE systemic aspects, focusing on the importance of new indicators capable of capturing both resource generation (upstream), product (downstream) and systems dimensions. This conceptual scheme is built around the case study of the City of Napoli's economy (Campania region, Southern Italy) considering the surrounding agro-industrial area with its smaller urban settlements. In order to design a reasonable and reliable CE framework, a number of already existing and innovative processes is analyzed and discussed, through a bottom-up procedure capable to account for CE development options based on the recovery of locally available and still usable resources (i.e., conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel, conversion of slaughterhouse residues to power and chemicals, recovery and conversion of agro-waste residues, amongst others).

The focus is to connect business success with social and ecological progress based on the operative concept of multifunctional land use. Such an approach attempts to harmonise the needs of the industrial processes of photovoltaic systems and the ecological and social needs of the landscape context. Dierent from the usual design of ground photovoltaic systems in farmlands or brownfields, a new framework is proposed, combining photovoltaic panels and vegetation. A case study is considered, applying the framework to existing photovoltaic systems in the Apulia region (southern Italy). The analysis shows how the framework has, among others, the major functions of increasing solar energy production, recycling wastewater, creating raw material for biofuel, as well as providing animal habitat and mitigating air temperature. The latter is preliminarily evaluated by means of modelling simulations performed with a computational fluid dynamics and microclimate model, ENVI-met. This approach opens up a new vision of the infrastructure design of photovoltaic systems which can produce new social and economic income. © 2020, The authors.","Creating shared value; Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Ground photovoltaic system; Land use; Multifunctional land use; Technology services; Water treatment and supply",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089597454

Consuming dead animal matter and recycling its nutrients stabilizes and structures food webs and therefore represents a key component of ecosystem functioning. Introduction of free-ranging domestic pet animals adds additional scavenger species to urban habitats, and increased predictability of carcass resources produced by human activities characterizes urban habitats. Here, we investigate the effect of urbanization on the composition of diurnal and nocturnal scavenger assemblages and on the ecological function of carcass removal by using a carcass placement experiment in Swiss urban and adjacent rural habitats. While diurnal and nocturnal scavenger assemblages changed considerably from rural to urban areas by comprising particularly more domestic cats in the latter, carrion consumption rate did not differ between the two habitats. Predictability of carcass occurrence increased carrion consumption rate in both urban and rural habitats but mainly native scavengers and not introduced domestic pets responded to the repeated placements. These results suggest that urbanization shapes scavenger assemblage compositions without affecting their ecological function. The mechanism is likely due to a behavioural change of native scavengers in response to the occurrence of domestic pets resulting in functional plasticity of urban scavenger assemblages. The functional plasticity might be facilitated by the increased carcass predictability and additional anthropogenic food resources in urban habitats exploited by nutritionally flexible native scavenger species.

Five categories of contributions are examined: irrigation returns flows for groundwater recharge; biodiversity and wildlife habitat; landscape aesthetic and cultural values; nutrient recycling and retention; and improved health, nutrition and living conditions. Knowing the economic value of such positive externalities would help to get the right policy incentives for better water use and increased water savings in a context of growing water scarcity. © 2020 Franco Angeli Edizioni.

Tehran’s municipal solid-waste management has adopted modern practices and technologies very slowly. This study proposes the optimum pathway to reach maximum environmental benefits as well as the most cost-effective technologies according to the financial limits. The hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA)–emergy approach is applied to utilize the life cycle emissions as an inventory database to estimate the ecosystem services provided by the natural ecosystem to dilute the emissions and compensate raw material consumption. Among organic waste-treatment options, composting is optimally chosen by the hybrid LCA–emergy approach while considering the LCA method solely; the anaerobic digestion is the preferable option. Recycling is the most preferable solution for paper, plastic, and glass in terms of energy recovery and cost saving. However, the budget constraint affects the results. Considering the budget constraint, 65% of ferrous metals are diverted from recycling into metal landfill. Cost reduction of recycling technologies may divert metal flow from landfill to recycling. The limited budget has a significant impact on recycling solutions. Overall, the combination of composting and source separation should be considered as the most sustainable and eco-friendly pathway in Tehran. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Emergy; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste; Tehran","Anaerobic digestion; Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Ecosystems; Environmental technology; Land fill; Life cycle; Recycling; Source separation; Sustainable development; Cost-effective technology; Emergy; Environmental benefits; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Raw material consumption; Recycling technology; Tehran; Waste management systems; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073997915

The semi-urban community of Ga-Makanye in the Limpopo Province of South Africa is situated adjacent to a small wetland ecosystem. Because this community is poorly serviced in municipal functions such as personal and domestic waste removal, it implies the wetland will be vulnerable to pollution. Thus, an investigation was conducted via an interview schedule during 2018 in this community to determine the effects of discarded litter on the wetland ecosystem as well as perceptions of adjacent residents towards this small urban wetland. Results indicated that of the 56 households surveyed 66% dispose their household waste near or in the wetland. Males under the age of 20 accounted for 60% of this litter. Nearly 60% of respondents thought that wetlands are not important from an ecological or ecosystem service point of view. Thus, it is not surprising that 66% of residents polled indicated that they intentionally target the wetland area for waste disposal with the intent of filling it up to create a parkland. Only 34% of residents indicated they recycle and reuse some of the waste they generate. It is concluded that lower to middle-income communities such as Ga-Makanye pose a significantly larger threat to their surrounding environment due to large amounts of waste generated and a throw-away mentality, than for example, a lower socio-economic status community, who tend to re-use and recycle more. © 2020 The Society of South African Geographers.","Domestic waste disposal; ecological impact; gender vs waste disposal; perceptions of wetlands; wetland",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093975378

However, plastic debris, as a consequence of film mulching, remains and accumulates in soil leading to severe soil quality problems, as well as environmental concerns especially the small fragmented particles referred to as microplastics (MPs). Though increasing attention has been aroused for MPs in the aquatic environment, the knowledge of MPs’ behavior and its effects on soil quality is extremely insufficient and urgently needed. In this study, we oriented the benefits of plastic film use, its contribution to agriculture productivity, and the effects of MPs on soil properties and its related soil quality indicators. Admittedly, the increasing trend of using plastic film made by light density of polyethylene would be continued in China, and the pieces of plastic particles would either be persistent and accumulated in soil layers or be slowly aging and degraded. The impacts of MPs on soil quality need more attention due to the limited studies available focusing on its fate and interactions associated with soil ecosystem services and environmental resilience. Although policies and agricultural extending services on plastic film application have been laughed for a few years, alternative materials used for producing environment-friendly film, plastic debris recycling, and solutions on pieced particle removal are the great challenges for sustainable farming.

Assessment of the systemic effects of the circular economy on a global scale from a holistic perspective is the need of the hour. This work addresses this challenge and models the circular economy in a planetary model with integrated human, ecological and industrial components. The circular economy is modelled as an industry which processes the used industrial goods. These are used along with the goods produced using virgin raw materials. Different time delays and circulation rates parameterize 90 different routes of implementation of the circular economy. These are implemented for nine levels of resource consumption increase by humans complemented by population growth. System collapse due to the scarcity of ecosystem-based resources occurs sooner as the consumption level increases. Model simulation results indicate substantial benefits of adopting the circular economy. Incorporation of circular economy delays the system collapse by at least a few decades and aggressive implementation of the circular economy, in several cases, avoided this collapse entirely. Based on these results, the time horizon of the next 70–90 years is identified as critical, before which a large scale implementation of the circular economy is essential. However, very aggressive implementation of circular economy leads to system collapse because of the depletion of common access ecosystem services caused by continued high consumption. Thus, this work establishes benefits of the circular economy and recommends a balanced approach for the adoption of the circular economy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Circular economy; Integrated model; Policy; Unsustainable resource consumption","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Population statistics; Public policy; Circular economy; Consumption levels; Ecosystem services; Global sustainability; Holistic perspectives; Industrial components; Integrated modeling; Resource consumption; Industrial economics; adaptive management; ecosystem service; environmental economics; holistic approach; policy approach; resource scarcity; resource use; sustainability; agriculture; Article; circular economy; compartment model; computer simulation; economic aspect; ecosystem; environmental sustainability; human; population growth; recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071971625

Therefore, understanding crop residue decomposition is recommended to evaluate soil changes and define a more sustainable sugarcane straw removal management for bioenergy production. The straw chemical composition may be an efficient indicator to investigate this complex process. Thus, we conducted a field study to assess the sugarcane straw composition changes over 1 year using DRIFT spectroscopy technique. The experimental design consisted of a split-plot and randomized block design, and straw removal rates provided the main plot factor with time of sampling as the split-plot factor. Three sugarcane straw removal rates were evaluated: no removal (~ 14.0 Mg ha−1 of dry mass), 50 (~ 7.0 Mg ha−1) and 75% (~ 3.5 Mg ha−1). Decreases in the absorbance associated with labile C (1200 to 1100 cm−1), and increases in more recalcitrant C (1800 to 1600 cm−1) were showed by the DRIFT spectra. In regional scale, the straw chemical composition was affected by environmental conditions, whereas at a local scale, the main driver was the decomposition time.

Most indicators of ecosystem services were influenced significantly by nutrient management practices. The energy efficiency (1.72) and net energy (19625 MJ ha−1) improved significantly in the organic nutrient practice due to lower energy input (30722 MJ ha−1) and higher energy output (50347 MJ ha−1). The mean values of the indicator of dependence on non-renewable energy sources and an indicator of farm autonomy for organic farms were 0.3 and 0.46, respectively. The study suggests 46% of the inputs produced in the farm were recycled in the organic farms. The significantly higher sustainability yield index (0.25), sustainability value index (0.44) and system economic efficiency (21 USD day−1) were observed in the organic nutrient system.

Middle East and North Africa (MENA, 1.9%) and Oceania (2.8%) in contrast appeared underrepresented. Megacities (> 5 million inhabitants) received less scientific attention than smaller agglomerations. 3.6% of UPA publications addressed heavy metals, of which 82% detected a contamination in plants, soil or irrigation water above recommended thresholds, but the thereby bioavailability of heavy metals remains unclear. Organic pollutants in contrast seem to be understudied. 1.7% of the studies focused on microbial contamination in UPA and 9.7% addressed socio-economic aspects of urban agriculture. The latter are very context specific and span from supplementation of food in poor households to market-oriented production. Only 2% of studies explicitly dealt with animal husbandry in UPA. This topic should receive more scientific attention, since the integration of urban animal husbandry with cropping systems has large potential for recycling of nutrients. Similarly, only 2.4% of studies examined urban foodsheds and food supply, despite the challenge of ongoing urbanization, which requires increasing source areas for feeding cities. Maintaining ecosystems services in an urban environment that is highly competitive for scarce resources such as space, water, labour and capital requires an efficient resource management at different spatial scales.

Arguably, these innumerable little creatures are far more important for the functioning of ecosystems than their furry or feathered brethren, but until recently we had few long-term data on their population trends. Recent studies from Germany and Puerto Rico suggest that insects may be in a state of catastrophic population collapse: the German data describe a 76% decline in biomass over 26 years, while the Puerto Rican study estimates a decline of between 75% and 98% over 35 years. Corroborative evidence, for example from butterflies in Europe and California (which both show slightly less dramatic reductions in abundance), suggest that these declines are not isolated. The causes are much debated, but almost certainly include habitat loss, chronic exposure to pesticides, and climate change. The consequences are clear; insects are integral to every terrestrial food web, being food for numerous birds, bats, reptiles, amphibians and fish, and performing vital roles such as pollination, pest control and nutrient recycling. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems will collapse without insects. These studies are a warning that we may have failed to appreciate the full scale and pace of environmental degradation caused by human activities in the Anthropocene. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"animal; biodiversity; biomass; environmental protection; insect; population dynamics; species extinction; Animals; Biodiversity; Biomass; Conservation of Natural Resources; Extinction, Biological; Insecta; Population Dynamics",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072783989

Quality compost have a high potential in sustaining plant health through disease suppressiveness mechanisms against soil-borne pathologies; however, this property needs to be standardized. In this work, leafy vegetable/chipped energy cardoon residues have used as common starting feedstock in three comparative composting piles differentiated for the aeration method (passive, active and manual turning). Compost from both passively and actively aerated static piles showed higher suppressive properties against Lepidium sativum damping-off caused by Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia minor. The enhanced suppressiveness was found associated to increased population levels of fungi and bacteria, combined with larger microbial activity and catabolic diversity. Compost community levels of physiological profiles were distributed within PCA biplots according to the gradient of suppressiveness and, putatively, their C-food bioavailability degree. The observed differences in stimulation and selection of microbiota may be related to specific molecular compost features. The two suppressive compost revealed either a distinct lipid composition, assessed by thermochemolysis and to the preservation of readily biodegradable molecules by lignocellulosic components, as detected in NMR analyses. Findings indicate the relevance of on-farm composting methods in shaping compost suppressive functions and give new information about the provisioning of bio-based products for sustainable plant disease management. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Bio-based products; By-product valorisation; Microbial biodiversity; Organic carbon; Soil-borne pathogens; Sustainable cropping",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069545162

The dense complex canopy and deep root system creates an optimum structure to provide large ET fluxes to the atmosphere, forming the source of precipitation. Extensive land use and land cover change (LULCC) from forest to agriculture in the arc of deforestation breaks this moisture recycling system. Crops such as soybean are planted in large homogeneous monocultures and the maximum rooting depth of these crops is far shallower than forest. This difference in rooting depth is key as forests can access deep soil moisture and show no signs of water stress during the dry season, while in contrast crops are highly seasonal with a growing season dependent on rainfall. As access to soil moisture is a limiting factor in vegetation growth, we hypothesised that if crops could access soil moisture, they would undergo less water stress and therefore would have higher evapotranspiration rates than crops which could not access soil moisture. We combined remote-sensing data with modelled groundwater table depth (WTD) to assess whether vegetation in areas with a shallow WTD had higher ET than vegetation in deep WTD areas. We randomly selected areas of forest, savanna, and crop with deep and shallow WTD and examined whether they differ on MODIS Evapotranspiration (ET), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), from 2001 to 2012, annually and during transition periods between the wet and dry seasons. As expected, we found no differences in ET, LST, and EVI for forest vegetation between deep and shallow WTD, which because of their deep roots could access water and maintain evapotranspiration for moisture recycling during the entire year. We found significantly higher ET and lower LST in shallow WTD crop areas than in deep WTD during the dry season transition, suggesting that crops in deep WTD undergo higher water stress than crops in shallow WTD areas. The differences found between crop in deep and shallow WTD, however, are of low significance with regards to the moisture recycling system, as the difference resulting from conversion of forest to crop has an overwhelming influence (ET in forest is ≈ 2mmd-1 higher than that in crops) and has the strongest impact on energy balance and ET. However, access to water during the transition between wet and dry seasons may positively influence growing season length in crop areas. © Author(s) 2019.",,"Crops; Deforestation; Drought; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Land surface temperature; Land use; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Structural optimization; Vegetation; Deep soil moisture; Enhanced vegetation index; Groundwater table depth; Growing season lengths; Land use and land cover change; Optimum structures; Remote sensing data; Wet and dry seasons; Water recycling; deforestation; evapotranspiration; growing season; land cover; land use; NDVI; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; soil moisture; water table; Amazonia; Glycine max; White tip die-back phytoplasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072646641

However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships. Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments. To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to re-imagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation. © 2019","Climate change mitigation; Environmental incomes; Forestry; Poverty alleviation; Rural economy; Small-growers; Wood products","Biodiversity; Carbon; Concrete products; Conservation; Deforestation; Developing countries; Economics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Laws and legislation; Regional planning; Timber; Tropics; Wood products; Climate change mitigation; Environmental incomes; Poverty alleviation; Rural economy; Small-growers; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; ecological economics; economic development; ecosystem service; environmental economics; forest management; forestry; green economy; landownership; market conditions; nontimber forest product; poverty alleviation; rural development; rural economy; tropical forest; wood; Biodiversity; Carbon; Concrete; Conservation; Deforestation; Developing Countries",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067204806

In particular, vast quantities of soils are used to create infrastructures or green spaces associated with new developments. Alternative solutions aimed at alleviating soil consumption are thus being encouraged. Creating urban soils by recycling waste from industrial and construction activities is feasible, but apart from their support function the resulting technosols should also be able to provide some ecosystem services such as the capacity to infiltrate water and filter contaminants. Various methods are routinely used for in situ characterization of the hydraulic behaviour of natural soils, but their ability to assess the hydraulic properties of technosols remains unclear. Indeed, technosols formed from recycled waste differ markedly from natural soil because they often contain a considerable proportion of coarse artefacts that affect their structure. In this study, results obtained by two distinct methods (ponding and tension infiltrometry), associated with two data processing methods (Beerkan estimation soil transfer (BEST) and numerical inversion), on a set of infiltration data measured on experimental plots made of technosols have been compared with each other. Both methods provided similar results and thus proved to be reliable when applied to technosols. Highlights: Reuse of by-products from anthropogenic activities is crucial to alleviate the consumption of natural soil. Hydraulic properties of technosols must be monitored to assess some of the ecosystem services they can provide. BEST and numerical inversion of multiple tension disc infiltration data gave consistent results. Reliability of the hydraulic characterization methods used for technosols deserves further inquiry. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science","experimental urban soils; infiltrometry method comparison; technogenic materials","assessment method; comparative study; data processing; ecosystem service; experimental study; human activity; hydraulic property; infiltration; infiltrometer; infrastructure; methodology; natural resource; reliability analysis; soil type; urban sprawl",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064036367

This study explores the factors that determine the different perceptions of the welfare impact of supplying reclaimed water to different, and competitive, ecosystems in the Segura River Basin (southern Spain): specifically, an agroecosystem (agricultural irrigation) and a river (higher river flow). The results of a contingent valuation exercise with the population of the Murcia Region show four different groups of respondents, depending on their willingness to pay (WTP) preferences. The factors that identify differences among welfare impacts are the age, the gender, the education level, the monthly income, the nearness of the household to the river, and, above all, the degree of satisfaction with funding of water reclamation. This study broadens our knowledge of individuals’ heterogeneous preferences in water reuse options, which is crucial for policy makers in the development of socially accepted and sustainable water resource management strategies. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Agroecosystem; Contingent valuation; Ecosystem services; Segura River Basin; Sociodemographic characteristics; Spain","Economic analysis; Rivers; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Agro ecosystems; Contingent valuations; Ecosystem services; Segura river basins; Socio-demographic characteristics; Spain; Ecosystems; river water; water; agricultural ecosystem; assessment method; competition (economics); contingent valuation; ecosystem service; perception; policy making; recycling; water management; water resource; welfare reform; willingness to pay; adult; agroecosystem; Article; case study; consumer attitude; contingent valuation; controlled study; educational status; female; funding; human; income; male; middle aged; normal human; river basin; river ecosystem; social welfare; Spain; waste water recycling; water supply; welfare; Willingness To Pay; Murcia [Spain]; Segura Basin; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067515630

The Inner Mongolian steppe is a major grassland ecosystem in Northern China, covering 13.5% of the northern Chinese grassland area, and playing important ecological roles for the adjacent region of the capital Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. Quantification of grassland ES under the different utilization patterns is vital for the maintenance of multiple ES and mitigation against ES loss in this region. We made a manipulative experiment with four grazing intensities (grazing exclusion, GE; light grazing intensity, LG; medium grazing intensity, MG; heavy grazing intensity, HG). We then quantified the intensities of eight different grassland ES (1. herbage intake, HT; 2. biodiversity conservation, BI; 3. soil nutrient retention, SN; 4 soil carbon stocks SC; 5. soil erosion prevention, SEP; 6. soil water storage, SWC; 7. potential nutrient recycling, PNC; 8. carbon sequestration from atmosphere. CS) and total ES via a series of field measurements. Pearson coefficients and trade-offs index were used to access the above ES relationships and degree of trade-offs between ES. Grazing intensities significantly (p < 0.05) affected the grassland intensities of ‘regulating’, ‘culture’ and ‘provisioning’ services, but the ‘supporting’ services. We found three types of relationships (trade-offs, synergy or neutral) have been found in this study. Trade-offs occurred between ‘provisioning’ and ‘regulating’ services. Although GE management presented significantly higher intensity of total ES (0.64) than LG (0.52), LG management significantly weakened the trade-offs between ‘provisioning’ and ‘regulating’ services (Trade-offs index 0.22) in comparison with GE (Trade-offs index 11.02). Our study suggests, therefore, that LG is the most suitable grassland utilization practice in the Inner Mongolian steppe. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-physical quantification; Ecosystem services; Grazing intensity; Inner Mongolian steppe; Trade-offs","Biodiversity; Carbon; Commerce; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Nutrients; Soil moisture; Bio-physical quantification; Ecosystem services; Grazing intensity; Mongolians; Trade off; Ecosystems; ecosystem approach; ecosystem service; grassland; grazing pressure; steppe; trade-off; Article; calculation; carbon sequestration; China; conservation biology; correlation coefficient; demography; ecosystem; environmental management; grassland; grazing; herbage; human; intermethod comparison; Mongolia; priority journal; recycling; steppe; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Nei Monggol; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064698792

Páramo systems are threatened by climate and land use changes. Rainfall generation processes and moisture transport pathways influencing precipitation in the Páramo are poorly understood but needed to estimate the impact of these changes, particularly during El Niño conditions, which largely affect hydrometeorological conditions in tropical regions. To fill this knowledge gap, we present a stable isotope analysis of rainfall samples collected on a daily to weekly basis between January 2015 and May 2016 during the strongest El Niño event recorded in history (2014–2016) in two Páramo regions of Central America (Chirripó, Costa Rica) and the northern Andes (Cajas, south Ecuador). Isotopic compositions were used to identify how rainfall generation processes (convective and orographic) change seasonally at each study site. Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) air mass back trajectory analysis was used to identify preferential moisture transport pathways to each Páramo site. Our results show the strong influence of north-east trade winds to transport moisture from the Caribbean Sea to Chirripó and the South American low-level jet to transport moisture from the Amazon forest to Cajas. These moisture contributions were also related to the formation of convective rainfall associated with the passage of the Intertropical Convergence Zone over Costa Rica and Ecuador during the wetter seasons and to orographic precipitation during the transition and drier seasons. Our findings provide essential baseline information for further research applications of water stable isotopes as tracers of rainfall generation processes and transport in the Páramo and other montane ecosystems in the tropics. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO); HYSPLIT; moisture recycling; precipitation; tropical Páramo; water stable isotopes","Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Ecosystems; Isotopes; Land use; Moisture; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; Tropics; Water recycling; Air mass back trajectories; Hydrometeorological conditions; HYSPLIT; Intertropical convergence zone; Orographic precipitation; Southern oscillation; Stable isotopic compositions; Water stable isotopes; Atmospheric movements; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; grassland; isotopic composition; moisture transfer; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; seasonal variation; stable isotope; Andes; Azuay; Cajas National Park; Costa Rica; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064553422

Some species are of economic importance as facultative agents of livestock myiasis. The interspecific ecological differences that facilitate coexistence within the blowfly community are not fully understood. The aim of this work was to quantify differences in habitat use by calliphorid species. Thirty traps were distributed among three habitats at two sites in southwest England for collections made during March–August 2016. A total of 17 246 specimens were caught, of which 2427 were Lucilia sericata, 51 Lucilia richardsi, 6580 Lucilia caesar, 307 Lucilia ampullacea, 4881 Calliphora vicina and 2959 Calliphora vomitoria (all: Diptera: Calliphoridae). Lucilia sericata was the dominant species in open habitats, whereas L. caesar was the most abundant species in shaded habitats. Calliphora specimens were more abundant in the cooler months. These findings suggest that Calliphora and Lucilia species show strong temporal segregation mediated by temperature, and that species of the genus Lucilia show differences in the use of habitats that are likely to be driven by differences in humidity tolerance and light intensity. These factors in combination result in effective niche partitioning. © 2018 The Royal Entomological Society","blowfly; Calliphora; competition; decomposer; habitat; humidity; Lucilia; microclimate; niche; temperature","carrion; coexistence; competition (ecology); ecosystem service; fly; habitat type; habitat use; microclimate; niche partitioning; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature effect; type specimen; article; Calliphora vicina; competition; decomposer; England; genus; habitat use; human; humidity; light intensity; Lucilia sericata; microclimate; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; animal; animal dispersal; Diptera; ecosystem; physiology; season; spatial analysis; time factor; England; United Kingdom; Calliphora; Calliphora vicina; Calliphora vomitoria; Calliphoridae; Diptera; Lucilia (blowfly); Lucilia ampullacea; Lucilia caesar; Lucilia richardsi; Lucilia sericata; Animal Distribution; Animals; Diptera; Ecosystem; England; Seasons; Spatial Analysis; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058841823

Stygofauna, or stygobionts -subterranean obligate aquatic animals - provide ecosystem services such as grazing biofilms and maintaining water quality, but we know little about how their ecosystems function. The cryptic nature of groundwaters, together with the high degree of local endemism and stygofaunal site-specific adaptations, represent major obstacles for the field. To overcome these challenges, and integrate biodiversity and ecosystem function, requires a holistic design drawing on classical ecology, taxonomy, molecular ecology and geochemistry. This study presents an approach based on the integration of existing concepts in groundwater ecology with three more novel scientific techniques: compound specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of amino acids, radiocarbon analysis ( 14 C) and DNA analyses of environmental samples, stygofauna and gut contents. The combination of these techniques allows elucidation of aspects of ecosystem function that are often obscured in small invertebrates and cryptic systems. Carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) CSIA provides a linkage between biogeochemical patterns and ecological dynamics. It allows the identification of stygofaunal food web structures and energy flows based on the metabolic pathway of specific amino groups. Concurrently, 14 C provides complementary data on the carbon recycling and incorporation within the stygobiotic trophic webs. Changes in groundwater environmental conditions (e.g. aquifer recharge), and subsequent community adaptations, can be pinpointed via the measurementof the radiocarbon fingerprint of water, sediment and specimens. DNA analyses are a rapidly expanding approach in ecology. eDNA is mainly employed as a biomonitoring tool, while metabarcoding of individuals and/or gut contents provides insight into diet regimes. In all cases, the application of the approaches in combination provides more powerful data than any one alone. By combining quantitative (CSIA and 14 C) and qualitative (eDNA and DNA metabarcoding) approaches via Bayesian Mixing Models (BMM), linkages can be made between community composition, energy and nutrient sources in the system, and trophic function. This suggested multidisciplinary design will contribute to a more thorough comprehension of the biogeochemical and ecological patterns within these undervalued but essential ecosystems. © 2019","14 C; Bayesian mixing models; CSIA; DNA metabarcoding; eDNA; Groundwater; Stygofauna; Trophic ecology","Animals; Aquatic ecosystems; Aquifers; Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; DNA; Groundwater; Groundwater geochemistry; Groundwater resources; Mixing; Molecular biology; Salinity measurement; Water quality; CSIA; eDNA; Mixing models; Stygofauna; ^14C; Recharging (underground waters); amino acid; carbon 13; carbon 14; DNA; genomic DNA; ground water; nitrogen 15; carbon; ground water; nitrogen; biomonitoring; carbon isotope; DNA; ecosystem function; fauna; food web; freshwater ecosystem; functional group; functional role; groundwater; trophic structure; water quality; aquatic fauna; aquatic invertebrate; aquifer; Bayes theorem; biogeochemistry; biological monitoring; carbon cycling; chemical analysis; chemical structure; community ecology; dietary intake; DNA barcoding; DNA determination; ecology; ecosystem monitoring; energy resource; energy transfer; environmental factor; environmental management; fauna; intestine content; isotope analysis; measurement; metabolism; nonhuman; nutrient management; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; radiometric dating; Review; sediment; stygofauna; trophic level; animal; aquatic species; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; ecology; environmental monitoring; growth, development and aging; procedures; standards; Animalia; Invertebrata; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biodiversity; Carbon Isotopes; Ecology; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Groundwater; Nitrogen Isotopes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060728403

However, air pollution abatement and the purification of stormwater are among the ecosystem services emphasized in studies of conventional green roofs. If rooftop farms actually capture pollutants, then accumulation of heavy metals in the soil could pose a problem over time. This study reports the heavy metal concentrations in soil, atmospheric deposition, and drainage output of 8 metals from the Brooklyn Grange Navy Yard Farm, rooftop vegetable farm in New York City, USA. Drainage of Pb and Mn were 6% and 14% of atmospheric bulk deposition, respectively, meaning that the Grange could be a net sink for Pb and Mn. Although there were small scale hotspots in the soil, farm-wide averages for heavy metal concentrations never exceeded guideline levels, and relatively low concentrations of Pb and Ba in the soil suggest that rooftop soils may be less vulnerable to contamination related to traffic and construction.

With the latter two, this order constitutes the Neuropterida, a smaller monophyletic subset among which it is the only entirely aquatic group, with larvae of all species requiring submersion in freshwater. Megaloptera is arguably the oldest extant clade of Holometabola with aquatic representatives, having originated during the Permian before the fragmentation of Pangea, since about 230 Ma. It includes 54 genera (35 extant and 19 extinct genera), with 397 extant described species and subspecies. Recent Megaloptera are divided into two families: Corydalidae (with subfamilies Corydalinae—dobsonflies and Chauliodinae—fishflies) and Sialidae (alderflies), both widely yet disjunctively distributed among zoogeographical realms. All species of Megaloptera have aquatic larvae, whereas eggs, pupae, and adults are terrestrial. The anatomy, physiology, and behavior of megalopteran larvae are specialized for an aquatic predatory habit, yet their ecological significance might still be underappreciated, as their role in food webs of benthic communities of many temperate and tropical streams and rivers is still understudied and largely unquantified. In many freshwater ecosystems, Megaloptera larvae are a conspicuous benthic component, important in energy flow, recycling of materials, and food web dynamics. © 2019 by the authors.

Taylor, J., School of Natural and Environmental Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom","The nitrogen cycle has been radically changed by human activities1. China consumes nearly one third of the world’s nitrogen fertilizers. The excessive application of fertilizers2,3 and increased nitrogen discharge from livestock, domestic and industrial sources have resulted in pervasive water pollution. Quantifying a nitrogen ‘boundary’4 in heterogeneous environments is important for the effective management of local water quality. Here we use a combination of water-quality observations and simulated nitrogen discharge from agricultural and other sources to estimate spatial patterns of nitrogen discharge into water bodies across China from 1955 to 2014. We find that the critical surface-water quality standard (1.0 milligrams of nitrogen per litre) was being exceeded in most provinces by the mid-1980s, and that current rates of anthropogenic nitrogen discharge (14.5 ± 3.1 megatonnes of nitrogen per year) to fresh water are about 2.7 times the estimated ‘safe’ nitrogen discharge threshold (5.2 ± 0.7 megatonnes of nitrogen per year). Current efforts to reduce pollution through wastewater treatment and by improving cropland nitrogen management can partially remedy this situation. Domestic wastewater treatment has helped to reduce net discharge by 0.7 ± 0.1 megatonnes in 2014, but at high monetary and energy costs. Improved cropland nitrogen management could remove another 2.3 ± 0.3 megatonnes of nitrogen per year—about 25 per cent of the excess discharge to fresh water. Successfully restoring a clean water environment in China will further require transformational changes to boost the national nutrient recycling rate from its current average of 36 per cent to about 87 per cent, which is a level typical of traditional Chinese agriculture. Although ambitious, such a high level of nitrogen recycling is technologically achievable at an estimated capital cost of approximately 100 billion US dollars and operating costs of 18–29 billion US dollars per year, and could provide co-benefits such as recycled wastewater for crop irrigation and improved environmental quality and ecosystem services. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"fresh water; nitrogen; surface water; fertilizer; nitrogen; agriculture; China; cropland; ecosystem restoration; energy cost; Letter; priority journal; recycling; reduction (chemistry); simulation; waste water management; water pollution; water quality; animal; catering service; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; nitrogen cycle; procedures; water pollutant; water quality; Agriculture; Animals; China; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Food Supply; Humans; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063325054

This study evaluated the production efficiency and sustainability of the straw-sheep-cropland integrated agroecosystem. This integrated system included four subsystems, as the sheep raising subsystem, the organic composting subsystem, the cropping subsystem and the feed producing subsystem. For the sheep raising subsystem, the emergy input of renewable resources was 2.33×1012 Sej, accounting for &lt;0.01%; the emergy input of non-renewable resources was 9.68×1015 Sej, accounting for 0.24%; the purchased economic resource emergy was 4.03×1018 Sej, accounting for 99.76%, in which feed and labor were two main components, with a proportion of 84.22% and 10.06% respectively. The emergy output of the sheep husbandary subsystem was 2.65×1019 Sej, including the sheep and manure, accounting for 17.70% and 82.30% respectively. For the organic composting subsystem, the emergy input of renewable resources was 7.69×1012 Sej, accounting for &lt;0.01%; the purchased economic resource emergy input was 2.44×1019 Sej, accounting for &gt;99.90%; in which the raw materials for producing organic fertilizers accounted for the most, including the manure and straw residues with a proportion of 89.31% and 8.81% respectively. The emergy output for the organic compost subsystem was 2.06×1019 Sej, including two sections with equal proportion, one for inside using and the other for outside selling. For the cropping subsystem, the emergy input of renewable resources was 1.12×1017 Sej, accounting for 6.16%; the non-renewable resource emergy input was 7.06×1015 Sej, accounting for 0.38%; the purchased economic emergy was 1.46×1018 Sej, accounting for 93.46%, in which the chemical fertilizer, labor, electricity, machinery and diesel were the main components with a proportion of 33.60%, 26.86%, 15.99%, 12.78% and 8.61%, respectively. The emergy output was 2.57×1018 Sej, including two parts, grain accounted for 54.08% and straw residues accounted with 45.91%. For the feed-production subsystem, the renewable resource emergy input was 1.95×1013 Sej, accounting for &lt;0.01%; the purchased economic resource was 1.23×1019 Sej, accounting for &gt;99.99%, in which the soybean meal and straw residues were two main components, with a proportion of 20.31% and 50.32%, respectively. The only emergy output was feed of 2.11×1019 Sej, with two parts with the inside using of 16.13% and outside selling of 83.87%. Results of evaluation for the integrated system showed that the unit emergy value (UEV) was reduced by 96.09%, which was suggested that the emergy use efficiency was greatly increased comparing to the single sheep husbandry. The emergy investment ratio (EIR) and environment loading ratio (ELR) were decreased by &gt;67.66%, respectively, while the emergy sustainability index (ESI) was evidently enhanced, suggesting that the integrated agroecosystem has a good sustainable potential with low environmental pressure. However, the net emergy yield ratio (EYR) and emergy yield-investment ratio were decreased by 70.32% and 70.43%, respectively, suggesting that the production efficiency and economic benefit were reduced in the integrated agroecosystem. This was caused by increasing cost from raw materials (i.e. bean dregs or straw residues), buildings and equipment. Therefore, the ecological compensation is needed for the positive externality of ecosystem services from the integrated agroecosystem. The compensation standard was estimated as ￥380.76/sheep per year based on the net emergy benefit difference. Nonetheless, once the current integrated system is optimized, EYR will be increased in theory and the integrated system can achieve self-compensation for its positive environmental benefits. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Scientific assessment of their value changes is a basis for rationally planning of the regional land use and constructing ecological security pattern. The existing studies did not comprehensively evaluate various ecosystem services to determine regional ecological basements. The current static assessments failed to reflect the dynamic process of regional ecological security patterns. Hence, using CASA, RUSLE, and other models, as well as the ecological economic method, we evaluated the ecosystem service value in Wafangdian County, Liaoning coastal area in 2000-2014. Then, the two-stage ecological security pattern was constructed based on the scientific assessment. The results are as follows: 1 during the 14 years, except for the inconspicuous change of nutrient recycling value, the other ecosystem service values have showed different degrees of loss, especially for water source conservation value with the worst decline of 44%. In terms of land use type, the value of forestland ecosystem services lost 874 million Yuan, up to 40% of the total loss. 2 For the ecosystem services per unit value of the study area in the two periods, water area (including sea) was higher than land, but mountain was higher than flatlands. This uneven spatial distribution was more obvious in 2014. 3 The ecological source areas in 2000 and 2014 were 1111.40 km2 and 356.96 km2, respectively. The total length of the corridors were 136.63 km and 231.43 km. The ring-like corridors were distributed in the high value valley of ecosystem service value among the source areas. The profit and loss of ecosystem service value have an impact on the construction of the regional ecological security pattern. The results can provide a scientific guideline for the delineation of urban development boundary and ecological protection red line in Wafangdian. © 2019 Science Press.

These efforts are widely constrained by the availability, cost, and suitability of substrates to support oyster settlement and reef establishment. In particular, oyster shell is often the preferred substrate but is relatively scarce and increasingly expensive. Thus, there is a need for alternative oyster restoration materials that are cost-effective, abundant, and durable. Methods: We tested the viability of two low-cost substrates-concrete and recycled blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) traps-in facilitating oyster recovery in a replicated 22-month field experiment at historically productive but now degraded intertidal oyster grounds on northwestern Florida's Nature Coast. Throughout the trial, we monitored areal oyster cover on each substrate; at the end of the trial, we measured the densities of oysters by size class (spat, juvenile, and market-size) and the biomass and volume of each reef. Results: Oysters colonized the concrete structures more quickly than the crab traps, as evidenced by significantly higher oyster cover during the first year of the experiment. By the end of the experiment, the concrete structures hosted higher densities of spat and juveniles, while the density of market-size oysters was relatively low and similar between treatments. The open structure of the crab traps led to the development of larger-volume reefs, while oyster biomass per unit area was similar between treatments. In addition, substrates positioned at lower elevations (relative to mean sea level) supported higher oyster abundance, size, and biomass than those less frequently inundated at higher elevations. Discussion: Together, these findings indicate that both concrete and crab traps are viable substrates for oyster reef restoration, especially when placed at lower intertidal elevations conducive to oyster settlement and reef development. © 2019 PeerJ Inc.

Utilization of soil biodiversity is necessary for optimization of the abovementioned ecosystem services and increasing use efficiency of natural as well as applied resources to meet the increasing demand. Soil biodiversity enhances use efficiency of applied nutrients by P solubilization/mobilization/mineralization, atmospheric N fixation, K solubilization/mobilization, siderophore production for Fe uptake, sulfur oxidation, and decomposition of organic matter to release trapped nutrients for plant uptake. Microbial consortia are very much useful in degrading various species of xenobiotics. Waste recycling by soil biodiversity has the largest economic benefit in terms of monetary value. This paper reviews the exploitation of soil biodiversity in respect to its utilization for enhancing nutrient use efficiency, and improving and maintaining the physical and chemical environment of soil, which all together can provide economic and environmental benefit towards maintaining agricultural sustainability.

However, this construction method is pointed out that it causes land subsidence and/or landslide in soft ground. For solving these problems, various new construction methods using the ground materials such as EPS (styrofoam), recycled foamed waste glass and expanded polystyrene beads have been developed as a new lightweight and workable composite geomaterials. These new construction methods are believed to be effective for construction on soft ground and landslide-prone areas. In existing researches of this field, they aimed to identify areas for improvement and the problems associated with the use of these new ground materials. However, there are few types of research that focused on negative impacts on land use, by exhausting air pollution and GHGs (Green House Gases) with recycling from the perspective of the environmental economics field. Thus, in this research, we compared conventional cut-and-fill method and some new ground materials such as the expanded polystyrol construction method using the new EPS geomaterial, the lightweight embankment construction method with EPS beads and the foamed waste glass construction method using embankment material with recycled waste by analyzing the negative impacts to land use considered ecosystem services and life cycle cost (LCC) including external cost by emissions of GHGs and air pollutants such as SOx and NOx using life cycle impact assessment analysis. © Int.

Nonetheless, it is debatable whether the presence of the pastoralists and livestock in Miombo woodlands is linked to the ecological degradation and resources use conflicts. Besides, the impact of Miombo woodlands utilization in relation to biodiversity and ecosystem service provision is not well understood. The current review describes the various concurrent issues underlying livestock production in Miombo woodlands and ecosystem resilience. Analytical review established that livestock in Miombo woodlands have a crucial role in enhancing food security and animal source protein requirement in the future. Ecologically, pastoralists’ presence in the Miombo serves biodiversity conservation, enhances nutrient recycling, and regulates wildfires. On the other hand, pastoralists are faced with several challenges including pests and diseases and persistent drought that leads to scarcity of water and pasture resources. Other setbacks include high enteric methane emission due to poor livestock productivity, unsustainable rangeland management practices, land tenure, and poor water management. Observations of wildlife interactions with the natural ecosystem elsewhere provide crucial evidence for the potential of livestock-woodland beneficial symbiotic interaction. It is concluded that, since there is high ecological compatibility of livestock production in Miombo woodlands, there is need to reform management policy to promote livestock interaction on the Miombo woodlands. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Animal genetic conservation; Food security; Livestock production; Livestock-woodland interaction; Miombo woodlands; Multiple land use; Ngorongoro Conservation Area",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071450965

Notably there have been cases of humpback whales getting entangled in 'ghost' fishing nets, and endangered turtles ingesting plastic wastes in Watamu beach in Kenya. The aim of the current study was to assess the composition and management of plastic waste discarded by households in Watamu ward. Stratified random sampling was used to collect data from households in four sub-locations within Watamu ward. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics (the Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher's Exact test). The composition of plastics usually discarded as waste by households in order of dominance were low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, high density polyethylene and polypropylene (FH=37.959, p = 0.000). From the results, only 0.7% of respondents recycled their plastic waste. The most preferred disposal method of household plastic waste was open dumpsites (61.4%) followed by burning (12.9%) and discards (6.4%). Majority of respondents (93.6%), re-use some plastic containers for food, water, and oil storage. There was a significant difference in terms of how the respondents re-used their plastic waste in the four sub-locations (FH=36.437, p=0.005). In conclusion, the current plastic waste disposal methods at Watamu are not environmentally friendly and recycling is still at a smaller scale despite its potential to generate income and clean the environment, and promote ecosystem services and human wellbeing. © 2019 GJESM.","Plastic composition; Plastic waste; Recycling; Reuse; Waste management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065083130

However, most mining activities usually target short-term financial benefits, rather than long-term consideration on ecological sustainability. To better understand the impact of metal production, systematic evaluation methods should be applied to complement current economic accounting tools. Under such a circumstance, this study proposes an emergy-based metal production evaluation framework, taking a life cycle perspective from the formation of mineral deposit to the final production of metal. Ecosystem service loss, CO 2 emissions, and emissions’ impact are quantified, evaluating the comprehensive performance of a lead and zinc production system in Yunnan Province of China. The results show that minerals contribute significantly to the formation of lead and zinc production; however, emergy received in terms of money substantially undervalues environmental work associated with production. Such a metal production system relies heavily on nonrenewable resources and put enormous pressures on local ecosystems. The beneficiation subsystem generates the highest negative impact per emergy output, followed by the smelting and refining subsystem and the underground mining subsystem. From climate change point of view, producing 1 ton of lead bullion leads to 1.79E+03 kg CO 2 eq. Electricity use contributes a dominated share to the total CO 2 emission of all subsystems. In addition, lead recycling can greatly reduce the overall CO 2 emission, indicating that it is necessary to build up a regional lead collection and recycling system. Finally, several policy suggestions are raised by considering the local realities, aiming to promote sustainable development of this industry. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO 2 emission; Emergy analysis; Environmental accounting; Governance; Lead and zinc","carbon dioxide; lead; zinc; analysis; China; economics; ecosystem; energy resource; environment; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; metallurgy; mining; procedures; Carbon Dioxide; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Energy-Generating Resources; Environment; Greenhouse Gases; Lead; Metallurgy; Mining; Zinc",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063030172

Construction of pastoral ecosystem is the key reform task for the green development of agriculture in China. It is an important part of the construction of ecological civilization in China and an important gripper for the implementation of the strategy of rural revitalization. Opinions on the innovating institutional mechanism to promote the green development of agriculture pointed out that China will develop the pastoral ecosystem with the combination of crop-animal combined production, ecological cycle, beautiful environment. The important position for restoration and conservation of pastoral ecosystems is further clarified in the green development of agriculture in China. Being a big province of agricultural green development, Zhejiang province has carried out work exploration about more than 20 years. Based on in-depth investigations, the study assessed the progress for construction and management of pastoral ecosystem in Zhejiang province. Zhejiang province pays attention to top-level design, introduces the forced mechanism, implements precise subsidy, and innovating technology, remarkable achievements have been made in the construction of the pastoral ecosystem. The results showed that 1) The preliminary ecological recycling agricultural system, including 110 eco-agricultural demonstration zones and 1000 demonstration subjects and more than 10 000 eco-beautiful pastures, has established. Its total area was 100 000 hm2, the three stage recycling pattern of ""small circulation of main body, circulation in the park, and great circulation in the county"" has formed. 2) The level of farmland environmental management has been significantly improved; zero growth and continuous reduction of pesticide and chemical fertilizer use have been achieved in Zhejiang Province. The utilization rates of livestock and poultry manure, crop straw, waste fungus rods from edible fungi and waste agricultural film reached 96%, 92%, 90% and 89% respectively, and the utilization rate of clean energy in rural areas reached 79%, formed the daily cleaning mechanism of farmland. 3) Effective protection and utilization of pastoral biological resources not only created pastoral landscape, but also improved pastoral infrastructure and promotes organic links between agricultural production, processing and service industries, promoted the fusion of eco-environment, industry and living in Zhejiang Province, promote the park transforming into scenic area, the pastoral transforming into garden, raised the pastoral value. The enormously positive progress in Zhejiang province have been made in industrialization of ecological agriculture, classification and recycling of input package, conservation and utilization of biological diversity and green subsidy system. However, restricted by lack of theoretical and technical basis for the government and operating entities, the overall development is still in the groping stage, the common problems such as low standardization, imperfect market mechanism and weak brand construction need to be solved urgently. We propose that the theoretical system and technical system of the pastoral ecosystem should be thoroughly studied and perfected, and then the top-level design scheme is formed and issued in time. On the other hand, in order to establish and improve the institutional mechanism, we suggested that pilot program for the construction of pastoral ecosystem are carried out, in order to construct system both green production technology and environmental management for pastoral ecosystem, launched legislation for ecological recycling agriculture, perfected the mechanism of industrial construction and market operation for the idyllic ecosystem. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

This and other environmental services, such as recycling water and maintaining biodiversity, provide major reasons for creating these reserves and for according them priority in government programs. The importance of reducing carbon emissions from deforestation has been the principal motivation for international funding, which has been key to creating and supporting extractive reserves, notably in the cases of Germany through the PPG7 program and Norway through the Amazon Fund. Estimating the amount of carbon in these reserves and the losses that have occurred from deforestation is essential as an input to making decisions that affect current and potential future extractive reserves. By 2014, there were 47 federal extractive reserves in Brazil’s Legal Amazonia region, of which 45 were in the Amazonian Tropical Forest Biome and 26 extractive reserves belonged to states, all of which were in the Amazonia Biome. This study provides data for each of the 73 extractive reserves in Legal Amazonia, based on biomass information by forest type calculated from RadamBrasil survey data, and deforestation from PRODES monitoring by LANDSAT or equivalent satellites (30-m resolution). The stocks represent carbon in the “pre-modern” biomass, that is, the biomass present in approximately 1970, or before substantial deforestation or logging activity in the region. The carbon losses reflect only deforestation, not degradation of forest by logging and/or fire. The total area of extractive reserves in Legal Amazonia amounted to 126,709 km2, of which 4301 km2 (3.4%) had been cleared by 2014. Those extractive reserves had a remaining carbon stock in forest vegetation (above and below-ground) of 2.1 billion tons. The carbon lost to deforestation totaled 74.9 million tons. Avoiding further carbon loss to both deforestation and degradation needs to be a high priority for the extractivists, as it is the value of the forest’s environmental services that has the greatest potential for providing a means of support that is increasing in value and is inherently sustainable. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

Perceived ecosystem services provided by rooftop farming include stormwater management and the production of affordable and nutritious vegetables for local consumption. However, intensive agriculture can increase nutrient loads to surface water, yet there is little empirical data from full-scale operational rooftop farms. This study reports the N balance and N management efficiency of the Brooklyn Grange Navy Yard Farm, a 0.61-ha farm atop an 11-story building in New York City USA. We monitored atmospheric N deposition, soil N concentration, N output by harvest, N leaching from soil, and drainage N output, in addition to estimating net N mineralization and the N load to sewers during the combined sewer overflows. We found that the annual drainage N output was 1,100% of the atmospheric bulk N deposition, and was 540% of the estimated total atmospheric N deposition, which makes the Brooklyn Grange a net N source in the urban environment. Annual N leaching from soil was 97% of fertilizer N input, and the efficiency of N management can be lower than in conventional vegetable production. For the Brooklyn Grange to integrate stormwater management and intensive agriculture, it will be important to use soil with greater water holding capacity within the range of readily available water, and to recycle drainage. This case study shows how the intensification of agriculture on rooftops should be managed for both the yield and quality of crops and to reduce N loss to storm drains, which affects aquatic ecosystems and water quality. © 2018 Harada, Whitlow, Templer, Howarth, Walter, Bassuk and Russell-Anelli.","Atmospheric deposition; Ecosystem services; Green roof; Nutrient runoff; Rooftop farming; Stormwater management; Urban agriculture; Urban sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054624780

Degraded areas in nineteen organically farmed European and Turkish vineyards resulted in producing significantly lower amounts of grapes and excessive concentrations of sugar. Plants suffered from decreased water nutrition, due to shallower rooting depth, compaction, and reduced available water capacity, lower chemical fertility, as total nitrogen and cation exchange capacity, and higher concentration of carbonates. Carbon storage and organic matter recycling were also depressed. The general trend of soil enzyme activity mainly followed organic matter stock. Specific enzymatic activities suggested that in degraded soils, alongside a general slowdown in organic matter cycling, there was a greater reduction in decomposition capacity of the most recalcitrant forms. The abundance of Acari Oribatida and Collembola resulted the most sensitive indicator of soil degradation among the considered microarthropods. No clear difference in overall microbial richness and evenness were observed. All indices were relatively high and indicative of rich occurrence of many and rare microbial species. Dice cluster analyses indicated slight qualitative differences in Eubacterial and fungal community compositions in rhizosphere soil and roots in degraded soils. This multidisciplinary study indicates that the loss of soil fertility caused by excessive earth movement before planting, or accelerated erosion, mainly affects water nutrition and chemical fertility. Biological soil fertility is also reduced, in particular the ability of biota to decompose organic matter, while biodiversity is less affected, probably because of the organic management. Therefore, the restoration of the eroded soils requires site-specific and intensive treatments, including accurately chosen organic matrices for fertilization, privileging the most easily decomposable. Restoring soil fertility in depth, however, remain an open question, which needs further investigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-ecosystem services; Biodiversity; Enzymes; Grape; Microarthropods; Restoration; Soil fertility; Soil functionality; Soil organic matter","carbonic acid derivative; nitrogen; soil organic matter; sugar; carbon; abundance; agricultural ecosystem; arthropod; biodiversity; cation exchange capacity; crop yield; decomposition; degradation; ecosystem service; enzyme activity; mite; restoration ecology; rhizosphere; soil erosion; soil fertility; soil organic matter; soil remediation; species evenness; species richness; vine; vineyard; agroecosystem; Article; bacterium; biodiversity; bioremediation; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; cation exchange; Collembola; concentration (parameters); controlled study; decomposition; enzyme activity; Europe; fungal community; grape; microbial community; nonhuman; nutrient supply; Oribatida; plant root; recycling; rhizosphere; rooting; soil degradation; soil erosion; soil fertility; Turkey (republic); vineyard; water availability; water supply; agricultural land; ecosystem; microbiology; soil; Europe; Turkey; Acari; Bacteria (microorganisms); Collembola; Oribatida; Vitaceae; Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecosystem; Farms; Nitrogen; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049324922

This paper aims to introduce a composite environmental indicator for assessing community resilience to floods, targeting regional-scale geospatial applications. The composite indicator has been built on conceptualized inter-relationships between Ecosystem Services (ESs) and community resilience. The environmental parameters used to measure the composite were identified by surveying the cross-disciplinary literature from the domains of ESs and disaster resilience. The application of the composite indicator was demonstrated by a case study in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The composite indicator was tested on flood declaration and community response data from Colombo. The application employed a Weighted Linear Combination Method (WLCM) and was executed in a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based platform. The geospatial data for application and validation were collected through secondary sources. The developed composite indicator consists of four proxy indicators (i.e., soil hydraulic properties, slope, land use, and a precipitation factor) and parameters used to measure them. The parameters were also derived from the conceptualized relationship that elaborates ESs into a bundle of services, including flood regulation, climate regulation, and nutrient recycling, whereas many of the existing resilience assessment methodologies focused only on flood regulation. Furthermore, the composite indicator organized the environmental parameters into two tiers, facilitating a range of users. Hence, incorporating this ESs-based composite indicator into existing resilience assessment methodologies could guide community resilience-building initiatives towards more sustainable outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Data-scares situation; Disaster; Geospatial indicator; Resilience assessment; Sri Lanka",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051774522

Climate change can affect soil functions both directly and indirectly. Direct effects include temperature, precipitation, and moisture regime changes. Indirect effects include those that are induced by adaptations such as irrigation, crop rotation changes, and tillage practices. Although extensive knowledge is available on the direct effects, an understanding of the indirect effects of agricultural adaptation options is less complete. A review of 20 agricultural adaptation case-studies across Europe was conducted to assess implications to soil threats and soil functions and the link to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The major findings are as follows: (a) adaptation options reflect local conditions; (b) reduced soil erosion threats and increased soil organic carbon are expected, although compaction may increase in some areas; (c) most adaptation options are anticipated to improve the soil functions of food and biomass production, soil organic carbon storage, and storing, filtering, transforming, and recycling capacities, whereas possible implications for soil biodiversity are largely unknown; and (d) the linkage between soil functions and the SDGs implies improvements to SDG 2 (achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture) and SDG 13 (taking action on climate change), whereas the relationship to SDG 15 (using terrestrial ecosystems sustainably) is largely unknown. The conclusion is drawn that agricultural adaptation options, even when focused on increasing yields, have the potential to outweigh the negative direct effects of climate change on soil degradation in many European regions. © 2018 The Authors.

Freshwater ecosystems are found throughout agricultural and urban landscapes and provide a wide range of ecosystem services, but globally they are also amongst the most vulnerable. In particular, ponds (lentic waters typically less than 2 ha), provide natural flood management, sequester carbon and hold significant cultural value. However, to inform their management it is important to understand (1) how functional diversity varies in response to disturbance and (2) the link between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. In this study, a meta-analysis of seven separate pond studies from across England and Wales was carried out to explore the effect of urban and agricultural land-use gradients, shading, emergent vegetation, surface area and pH upon groups of functionally similar members of the macroinvertebrate fauna. Functional effect groups were first identified by carrying out a hierarchical cluster analysis using body size, voltinism and feeding habits (18 categories) that are closely related to biogeochemical processes (e.g. nutrient and carbon recycling). Secondly, the influence of the gradients upon effect group membership (functional redundancy—FR) and the breadth of traits available to aid ecosystem recovery (response diversity) was assessed using species counts and functional dispersion (FDis) using 12 response traits. The effect of land-use gradients was unpredictable, whilst there was a negative response in both FR and FDis to shading and positive responses to increases in emergent vegetation cover and surface area. An inconsistent association between FDis and FR suggested that arguments for taxonomic biodiversity conservation to augment ecosystem functioning are too simplistic. Thus, a deeper understanding of the response of functional diversity to disturbance could have greater impact with decision-makers who may relate better to the loss of ecosystem function in response to environmental degradation than species loss alone. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","ecosystem functioning; ecosystem services; functional resilience; nutrient recycling; ponds; response diversity","biodiversity; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; freshwater ecosystem; functional response; land use; nutrient cycling; pond; England; United Kingdom; Wales; fresh water; agriculture; animal; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem restoration; England; pond; Wales; Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate Change; England; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Fresh Water; Ponds; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045926600

It outlines a new framework for modelling of more sustainable decision-making of farmers under the auspices of ecosystem services. It is intended for practical application in extension and farmer communication to show values of rotations referring to natural capital. In the past farmers created complex rotations to benefit from ecological processes which enabled them to control natural pests (at least partly), to build soil fertility on recycling of organics (humus formation), and to promote pollination (including wild bees and other insects) and water retention (diverse water requests of different crops). Farmers which were accommodating cropping orders in small parcels of fields used long lists of crop sequences and offered mixed farming systems: this was a major feature of agriculture. Cropping orders evolved from necessity and were followed as rules. Today we are faced with large fields and monoculture, instead, and ecosystem services are diminished. Usually, attempts to recognize economic pay-offs from rotation through modelling are meagre because of complexity. We address the issue of complexity by suggesting a new flexible type of modelling crop rotations (dynamic optimization) which condenses ecological information into matrices. A newly-hosted transfer matrix shall delineate the impacts of cropping patterns in period t to fertility of land in t + 1. Categorizing different states of nature (which have to be brought in line with farmers' knowledge of externalities), it can be implemented in models on rotation decision. © 2018 by the authors.","Crop rotation modelling; Dynamic programming; Spatially explicit","agricultural modeling; complexity; crop rotation; cropping practice; decision making; economic analysis; ecosystem service; linear programing; natural capital; pest control; soil fertility; soil management; spatial analysis; Apoidea; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049162234

Sea-ice losses around West Antarctica's continental shelf generate longer phytoplankton blooms but also make it a hotspot for coastal iceberg disturbance. This matters because in polar regions ice scour limits blue carbon storage ecosystem services, which work as a powerful negative feedback on climate change (less sea ice increases phytoplankton blooms, benthic growth, seabed carbon and sequestration). This resets benthic biota succession (maintaining regional biodiversity) and also fertilizes the ocean with nutrients, generating phytoplankton blooms, which cascade carbon capture into seabed storage and burial by benthos. Small icebergs scour coastal shallows, whereas giant icebergs ground deeper, offshore. Significant benthic communities establish where ice shelves have disintegrated (giant icebergs calving), and rapidly grow to accumulate blue carbon storage. When 5000km2 giant icebergs calve, we estimate that they generate approximately 106 tonnes of immobilized zoobenthic carbon per year (tCyr-1). However, their collisions with the seabed crush and recycle vast benthic communities, costing an estimated 4×104 tCyr-1. We calculate that giant iceberg formation (ice shelf disintegration) has a net potential of approximately 106 tCyr-1 sequestration benefits as well as more widely known negative impacts.

The Ecopath approach and software were used to represent the lake ecosystem, and input parameters were obtained from in-situ surveys and from published lake specific sources. The model was balanced as per the recommended ecological and thermodynamic constraints. The low ecotrophic efficiency found for adult catfish, primary producers and detritus suggest that these resources are not fully utilized, while other groups have moderate to high values. The annual fishery catch represents only about one sixth of the total fish biomass, and the exploitation rates of target species are well below 0.5 suggesting under-exploitation. The dietary intake of fish-eating birds is 5.8 t km–2 year–1 almost twice the catch, showing the lake's important role for sustaining the bird populations and hence, caution needs to be taken before implementing any further fisheries development intervention. The mean trophic level of the catch (2.55) is intermediate when compared to other tropical lake systems and reflects the mixed fishery of the lake. Mixed Trophic Impact and Niche Overlap analysis reveals that, contrary to what may be expected, the impact of the introduced exotic carp species on the lake system is less significant than that of the native species. Besides its socio-economic significance, the detritivorous carp seems to fill an unutilized niche and helps the system in recycling organic matter. The P/R value (3.2) and other system maturity indices indicate that Lake Koka is as yet an immature, developing system. The model can be used as a reference for exploring ecosystem-based fisheries management scenarios aimed at sustaining fish stocks, ecosystem services as well as ecological integrity. © 2018","Ecopath; Exotic species; Food web; Mixed trophic impact; Trophic model","Birds; Fish; Fisheries; Lakes; Ecopath; Exotic species; Food webs; Mixed trophic impacts; Trophic models; Ecosystems; biomass; catch statistics; cyprinid; dietary intake; ecological impact; ecological modeling; ecosystem service; energy flow; exploitation; fishery; fishery management; fishery modeling; food web; introduced species; invasive species; lake ecosystem; niche overlap; primary production; trophic interaction; trophic structure; Ethiopia; Kenya; Koka Reservoir; Rift Valley; Aves; Bischofia javanica; Cyprinidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045404698

Ecosystem service approach is an emerging paradigm to address natural resource degradation and achieve sustainability in agribusiness organizations. A case study method is used to identify environmental issues at one of the premium wine organizations based in South Australia. This study conducts semi-structured interviews with multiple informants to analyze how this organization integrates ecosystem services approach in their management systems. These semi-structured interviews with multiple informants identified three categories of environmental issues: (1) primary (water use efficiency, soil health, carbon emissions), (2) secondary (energy, water availability), and (3) tertiary (waste water recycling, salinity in soil, loss of biodiversity, impacts due to climate change projections, winery waste management, soil carbon). We used Ecosystem Based Business Risk Analysis Tool (EBBRAT) and found freshwater availability as a major risk for this organization. This tool led to the identification of key areas, such as biological control of insect pests, maintaining biodiversity and management of soil, as an opportunity for the wine company to enhance sustainability. This study highlights ecosystem service approach to achieve sustainability in wine and other agribusiness organizations. This case study is followed by two interactive exercises to illustrate the application of the ideas discussed in the chapter.

However, this practice alone is not sufficient to guarantee the quality of life that high quality water services underpin, especially within a context of increased urbanisation. As such, the idea of water reuse has been gaining momentum for some time and has recently found a more general context within the idea of the Circular Economy. This paper is set within the context of an ongoing discussion between centralized and decentralized water reuse techniques and the investigation of trade-offs between efficiency and economic viability of reuse at different scales. Specifically, we argue for an intermediate scale of a water reuse option termed ‘sewer-mining’ which could be considered a reuse scheme at the neighbourhood scale. We suggest that sewer mining (a) provides a feasible alternative reuse option when the geography of the wastewater treatment plant is problematic, (b) relies on mature treatment technologies and (c) presents an opportunity for Small Medium Enterprises (SME) to be involved in the water market, securing environmental, social and economic benefits. To support this argument, we report on a pilot sewer-mining application in Athens, Greece. The pilot, integrates two subsystems: a packaged treatment unit and an information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. The paper reports on the pilot's overall performance and critically evaluates the potential of the sewer-mining idea to become a significant piece of the circular economy puzzle for water. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Sewer-mining; Smart water systems; SMEs; Water reuse","ecosystem service; information and communication technology; public service; quality of life; service provision; sewer network; small and medium-sized enterprise; urbanization; wastewater treatment plant; water use; Article; conductance; entrepreneurship; Greece; mining; Monte Carlo method; neighborhood; sewer; urban area; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; entrepreneurship; environmental protection; human; quality of life; sewage; waste water; water management; water supply; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece; water; Conservation of Natural Resources; Entrepreneurship; Greece; Humans; Quality of Life; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water; Water Purification; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024102382

Vegetable cropping systems are high-input and generally require large quantities of fertilization, frequent irrigation, and repeated tillage operations. Consequently, an increase in global vegetable production may have seriously negative impacts on soil health and ecosystem services. Yet, not only maintaining but improving soil health is critical to enhancing the sustainability of food production systems. Previous agricultural research mainly focused on field crop systems and largely ignored vegetable cropping systems; consequently, this represents a conspicuous research gap, one that must be addressed in order to make progress toward sustainable food production. Here, we review the literature to gain a better understanding of how management has influenced various soil health indices (soil biology, chemistry, and physical dynamics) and to evaluate the implications for soil ecosystem services in vegetable cropping systems. We found that alternative modifications to conventional vegetable production systems, which resemble methods used in organic or conservation agriculture, tended to improve aspects of soil health. For example, soil amendments generally improved soil chemical and nutrient indices of health-soil carbon levels and nitrogen reserves in particular. Incorporation of cover crops to vegetable crop rotations tended to improve nitrogen recycling via reduced nitrate leaching risks, increased soil carbon levels, and weed suppression. Reduced tillage systems were rare, presenting an important challenge and opportunity for further improving soil health dynamics in vegetable production. Notably, adopting alternative practices generally had no effect on crop yields, which implies little risk of yield penalties when agronomic management is carefully planned. Our results indicate that future sustainable vegetable cropping systems may embody a blend between organic and conventional ideologies to better maintain or improve soil ecosystem functioning. © 2018 Norris and Congreves.","Carbon sequestration; Cover crops; Organic agriculture; Organic amendments; Reduced tillage; Soil health; Soil nutrients; Vegetable production",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048829066

Local authority natural burial sites have received far less attention from researchers than independent sites developed by farmers, charitable trusts, funeral directors and land owners. Here we argue that the local authority hybrid cemeteries that combine natural burial with traditional graves may have a far greater impact in delivering regulatory and cultural ecosystem services than the much larger and frequently more environmentally ambitious natural burial grounds developed by the independent sector. The article presents three case studies of cemeteries, each of which represents a different interpretation of natural burial. Two have retrofitted natural burial into an existing cemetery landscape. The third is a new cemetery where natural burial was included with traditional burial in the original design brief and planning application. The research reveals how natural burial is transforming the traditional cemetery, with its focus on an intensively managed lawn aesthetic, towards a more habitat rich and spatially complex landscape with its own distinctive identity. The research also reveals how natural burial (within the unique constraints of UK burial culture that does not permit the recycling of burial space) is increasing the burial capacity of urban cemeteries by accessing land and grave space that might not be suitable or appropriate for more traditional forms of burial. © 2017 The Authors","Ecosystem services; Identity; Lawn cemetery; Natural burial; Woodland","burial (geology); complexity; cultural landscape; design; ecosystem service; local government; regulatory framework; research work; spatial analysis; urban area; woodland; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028365113

Researchers and policy makers have become aware of this fact and call for limiting development and compensating for new soil sealing with unsealing measures. In a literature review, we found that the state of research about the impacts of soil sealing is far more advanced than about the potential and prerequisites of unsealing. In practice, soil restoration after mining and construction activities as well as redevelopment or renaturation of abandoned industrial sites are increasingly important issues, but systematic research on the success of soil unsealing and restoration is rare. In particular, the development of soils and vegetation after unsealing and restoration measures as well as their potential to provide ecosystem services need more detailed investigation. In 3 case studies, we demonstrate that replacing a sealed surface with soil to restore ecosystem services is always beneficial for humans and nature. An indicator-based mapping approach revealed the potential performance of different ecosystem services at former industrial sites in Switzerland. When unsealed sites are transformed to pioneer habitats, the intended vegetation may successfully be regained, but landscape connectivity is hardly enhanced due to increased overall landscape fragmentation. Our investigations show that with the techniques currently applied, the soil physical parameters in a restored agricultural soil developed favourably for crop growth within 15 years. However, unsealed soils are anthropogenic soils with reduced multifunctionality, and protecting natural soil against sealing is always the better option.

Herein, we conceptualized a techno-ecological integration between a rubber plantation and latex processing. We applied a two-component framework to describe and model the resulting techno-ecological interactions to analyze the potential benefits in latex productivity and carbon capture as ecosystem services. The ecological component includes: processes in the rubber plantation affecting carbon, nitrogen, water, biomass, and latex production. The technological component includes: latex concentration process; effluent treatment and anaerobic digestion (AD) to recover water, nutrients and energy. The main synergistic interaction was through the recycling of nutrients, which allowed maintaining nutrient availability for tree growth and increase latex yield. Water recovered was recycled within the technological component to save 85% of freshwater for latex processing. Water for irrigation came from external sources. The resulting system potentially enhances carbon capture and latex production by 16% and 62%, respectively, compared to a conventional plantation (no irrigation and fertilization only in the establishment stage). In addition, our LCA based environmental assessment showed that the major global warming (GWP), acidification (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP) impacts come from nitrogen emissions in the plantation and electricity used for water irrigation and latex processing. The conceptual techno-ecological integration reduced the impacts from fertilizer input, water for processing, water treatment and heat, by 78% of GWP, 64% of AP and 79% of EP, with respect to a non-integrated system. 11.7% of the total nitrogen required throughout the plantation cycle is supplied by chemical fertilizer during establishment stage, but the GWP, EP and AP impacts from this are offset by the 88.3% coming from recycling during the productive stage.

Whilst P recovery and recycling are central strategies for closing the P cycle, additional gains in environmental performance of food systems can be obtained by further minimising the amounts of P (a) introduced into the food system by lowering system P demand and (b) lost from the system by utilising legacy P stores in the landscape. This minimisation is an important cascading component of circularisation because it reduces the amounts of P circulating in the system, the amounts of P required to be recycled/recovered and the storage of unused P in the landscape, whilst maintaining agricultural output. The potential for circularisation and minimisation depends on regional differences in these P flow dynamics. We consider incremental and transformative management interventions towards P minimisation within circular economies, and how these might be tempered by the need to deliver a range of ecosystem services. These interventions move away from current production philosophies based on risk-averse, insurance-based farming, and current consumption patterns which have little regard for their environmental impact. We argue that a greater focus on P minimisation and circularisation should catalyse different actors and sectors in the food chain to embrace P sustainability and should empower future research needs to provide the confidence for them to do so without sacrificing future regional food security. © 2018 by the authors.","Circular economy; Circularisation; Efficiency; Food system; Minimisation; Phosphorus; Resilience; Sustainability","econometrics; ecosystem service; efficiency measurement; environmental impact assessment; food; food production; food security; phosphorus; price dynamics; recycling; research work; sustainability; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047789926

The large amount of animal wastes from industrial feedlots cannot be fully used on nearby farmlands, leading to severe environmental problems. Using China as a case study, we found that most dairy feedlots employ a semicoupled mode that only recycles solid manure to farmlands, and only a few dairy feedlots employ a fully coupled mode that recycles both solid and liquid animal manure. To produce 1 ton of milk, the fully coupled mode could reduce greenhouse gas (including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in this paper) emissions by 24%, ammonia emissions by 14%, and N discharge into water by 29%, compared with the semicoupled systems. Coupling feedlots with constructed wetlands can further result in greater mitigation of N leaching into groundwater. However, the fully coupled system has not been widely used due to the low benefit to farmers and the institutional barrier that the feedlot owners have no right to use adjacent farmlands. Since a fully coupled system improves net ecosystem services that favor the public, a policy that supports removing the economic and institutional barriers is necessary. Our approach provides a template for mitigating environmental impacts from livestock production without sacrificing milk production. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Animals; Carbon dioxide; Dairies; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Manures; Nitrogen oxides; Wetlands; Ammonia emissions; Animal manure; Constructed wetlands; Ecosystem services; Environmental problems; Institutional barriers; Livestock production; Milk production; Farms; ammonia; carbon dioxide; green manure; ground water; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; agricultural land; constructed wetland; dairy farming; developing world; domestic waste; ecosystem service; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; groundwater; livestock farming; manure; milk production; nitrous oxide; agricultural land; agricultural waste; anaerobic fermentation; Article; carbon footprint; China; constructed wetland; cost benefit analysis; crop production; dairy cattle; ecosystem; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; industrialization; leaching; livestock; manure; milk production; waste management; agricultural land; animal; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; milk; China; Animalia; Animals; China; Ecosystem; Farms; Greenhouse Effect; Manure; Methane; Milk; Nitrous Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045006310

Recent study is exposing the soil microbial community as not only decomposing SOM, but also providing the primary source of chemicals for its formation. All else equal, SOM formation is theoretically greatest when microbes maximise enzyme efficiency (ratio of enzyme activity to carbon loss from respiration) and biomass efficiency (biomass gain per unit substrate added). Our study examines the relationship between microbial composition and metrics of these two efficiencies. We hypothesised that both will increase with higher ratios of soil fungi to bacteria. We manipulated microbial composition through sustained use of selective microbial inhibitors in microcosms with tropical soil, alongside variation of litter quality and diversity and the presence or absence of a simulated root exudate. Both litter and inhibitor treatments significantly changed soil microbial composition and function, and enzyme efficiency and biomass efficiency were both higher in microbial communities with more fungi, supporting our hypothesis. Structural equation modelling suggested that the observed efficiency changes did indeed occur in part via changes in microbial composition after accounting for direct effects of treatments. Taken together the results provide some support for the hypothesis that soil fungi benefit SOM formation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bacteria; Carbon sequestration; Fungi; Litter decomposition; Microcosms; Selective inhibitors","Bacteria; Biomass; Decomposition; Ecology; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Enzyme activity; Enzymes; Forestry; Fungi; Microorganisms; Water recycling; Carbon sequestration; Litter decomposition; Microbial communities; Microbial composition; Microcosms; Selective inhibitors; Soil microbial community; Structural equation modelling; Soils; bacterium; carbon cycle; community composition; decomposition; ecosystem service; enzyme activity; fungus; inhibitor; litter; microbial activity; microbial community; microcosm; soil organic matter; tropical soil; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037535681

There is now a re-vitalized interest in increasing yields in organic agriculture to provide more organic food for a growing, more affluent population and reduce negative impacts per unit produced. However, past yield increases have been accompanied by several negative side-effects. Here, we review risks and opportunities related to a broad range of sustainability domains associated with increasing yields in organic agriculture in the Northern European context. We identify increased N input, weed, disease and pest control, improved livestock feeding, breeding for higher yields and reduced losses as the main measures for yield increases. We review the implications of their implementation for biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient losses, soil fertility, animal health and welfare, human nutrition and health and farm profitability. Our findings from this first-of-its-kind integrated analysis reveal which strategies for increasing yields are unlikely to produce negative side-effects and therefore should be a high priority, and which strategies need to be implemented with great attention to trade-offs. For example, increased N inputs in cropping carry many risks and few opportunities, whereas there are many risk-free opportunities for improved pest control through the management of ecosystem services. For most yield increasing strategies, both risks and opportunities arise, and the actual effect depends on management including active mitigation of side-effects. Our review shows that, to be a driving force for increased food system sustainability, organic agriculture may need to reconsider certain fundamental principles. Novel plant nutrient sources, including increased nutrient recycling in society, and in some cases mineral nitrogen fertilisers from renewable sources, and truly alternative animal production systems may need to be developed and accepted. © 2018, The Author(s).","Animal welfare; Biodiversity; Environment; Nutrition; Organic agriculture; Soil fertility; Yield","agricultural management; animal welfare; biodiversity; breeding; crop yield; cropping practice; ecosystem service; farming system; nutrition; organic farming; soil fertility; sustainability; trade-off; Europe; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042867508

Banana is perennial in nature with plantations as old as 50 years reported in the African Great Lakes region. Banana is cultivated in a wide range of agroecologies (from sea level to 2400 m a.s.l.) and cropping systems, where it contributes to various ecosystem services (ES). These include regulating soil erosion, water cycles and quality, and nutrient recycling. However, the outbreak of Xanthomonas wilt of banana (XW) along with some of its management practices, such as uprooting mats/entire fields, is devastating banana production and rendering landscapes bare and prone to degradation. Yet this process is also leading to diversification of agroecosystems in over 70% of farms in the African Great Lakes region with unknown but potentially positive consequences for resilience and adaptation, as well as for local diets. The sustainability of these alternative land-uses is variable. This study reviews the different services offered by banana plantations and the impacts, positive or negative, that XW-driven diversification may have on these services. It suggests the need to consider explicitly the consequences of pests and diseases for the full range of ES provided by the crop and an ES-broad framework for estimation of losses, and planning resources and strategies for disease management. The study also suggests strategies, such as incorporation of shade- and drought-tolerant cover crops, hedges and agroforestry trees, to augment the supply of key ES within XW-affected agroecosystems/landscapes. © International Society for Horticultural Science.

Principal players in this biodiversity are arthropods that help to decompose litterfall, favoring the recycling of nutrients and, hence, are an important part in sustaining the forest fragments that remain in urban areas. Therefore, it is important to study arthropod biodiversity in green urban areas, especially those areas where litterfall management is an important part of maintaining biodiversity. Accordingly, this study evaluated arthropod diversity associated with litterfall in three urban forests with different size and litterfall management practices, including água Branca Park (ABP) and Tietê Ecological Park (TEP)-Núcleo Engenheiro Goulart in São Paulo City and Chico Mendes Park (CMP) in Osasco City, all belonging to the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP), Brazil. Four litterfall harvests were carried out in each park between April and August of 2015 with twelve samples collected with a wood mold (30-cmx30-cm) at randomly points on the forest floor. The collected material was then screened in the laboratory and the arthropods were visually separated and preserved in alcohol 70%. Arthropods were classified by the order to which they belonged. Litterfall was dried in a forced air oven at 65 °C for seven days. Dried litterfall was then separated into leaves, branches, reproductive parts and miscellaneous fragments and weighed. Arthropod diversity was measured by Shannon, Margalef and Pielou indexes and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) using the Manhattan distance index. Litterfall weight was compared by one-way ANOVA. The orders Hymenoptera, Collembola and Isopoda were dominant in CMP, ABP and TEP, respectively but multiple rare orders had a presence in all parks, albeit at different abundance. NMDS showed abundance similarity among the parks; however, TEP showed greater richness, Shannon diversity and evenness. The fractions of leaf litterfall and reproductive parts were different between the CMP and TEP. Overall, our results confirm that neither litterfall management, nor park size, is a final determinant of arthropod distribution, even though the abundance of dominant species was shown to differ in each park. © 2018 by the authors.","Distribution of abundance; Soil arthropods; Urban park","abundance; arthropod; biodiversity; conservation management; ecosystem service; forest floor; forest soil; habitat fragmentation; litterfall; management practice; metropolitan area; park design; soil biota; species diversity; species evenness; species richness; urban area; Brazil; California; Chico; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; United States; Arthropoda; Collembola; Hymenoptera; Isopoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042795877

These include supporting services such as nutrient recycling and storage, structural habitat, substrate and food web modification, and use as environmental monitors; regulating services such as water purification (biofiltration); and provisioning and cultural services including use as a food source, as tools and jewelry, and for spiritual enhancement. Mussel-provided ecosystem services are declining because of large declines in mussel abundance. Mussel propagation could be used to restore populations of common mussel species and their ecosystem services. We need much more quantification of the economic, social, and ecological value and magnitude of ecosystem services provided by mussels, across species, habitats, and environmental conditions, and scaled up to whole watersheds.

Logging residue extraction can replace fossil fuels, and thus contribute to climate change mitigation. The additional biomass and nutrients removed, and soils and other structures disturbed, have several potential environmental impacts. To evaluate potential impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity we reviewed 279 scientific papers that compared logging residue extraction with non-extraction, the majority of which were conducted in Northern Europe and North America. The weight of available evidence indicates that logging residue extraction can have significant negative effects on biodiversity, especially for species naturally adapted to sun-exposed conditions and the large amounts of dead wood that are created by large-scaled forest disturbances. Slash extraction may also pose risks for future biomass production itself, due to the associated loss of nutrients. For water quality, reindeer herding, mammalian game species, berries, and natural heritage the results were complicated by primarily negative but some positive effects, while for recreation and pest control positive effects were more consistent. Further, there are initial negative effects on carbon storage, but these effects are transient and carbon stocks are mostly restored over decadal time perspectives. We summarize ways of decreasing some of the negative effects of logging residue extraction on specific ecosystem services, by changing the categories of residue extracted, and site or forest type targeted for extraction. However, we found that suggested pathways for minimizing adverse outcomes were often in conflict among the ecosystem services assessed. Compensatory measures for logging residue extraction may also be used (e.g. ash recycling, liming, fertilization), though these may also be associated with adverse environmental impacts. © 2017 The Authors","Bioenergy; Clear-felling; Environment; Forestry; Slash; Stumps; Whole-tree harvesting","carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; trace metal; water; biodiversity; bioenergy; biomass; clearcutting; dead wood; disturbance; ecosystem service; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; extraction method; forest management; harvesting; logging (timber); plant residue; berry; biodiversity; biomass; biomass production; ecosystem; environmental impact; Europe; extraction; fish; forest pest; greenhouse effect; habitat; inheritance; logging; mammal; North America; nutrient; nutrient concentration; pest control; pollination; recreation; reindeer; Review; soil; soil acidification; soil quality; vegetation; water quality; animal; environmental protection; forestry; tree; North America; Northern Europe; Mammalia; Rangifer tarandus; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Europe; Forestry; North America; Trees",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040019817

As a result, there has been substantial interest in iron-fertilizing high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) areas in an effort to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. More recently, research has shifted to quantifying the beneficial effects of iron recycling by marine biota. Marine top predators such as whales and seabirds have been examined specifically in this regard as they have high biomass, form dense aggregations, and excrete bioavailable iron in concentrations seven orders of magnitude higher than ambient seawater. Despite it being well established that marine fauna link the iron and carbon cycles, the connection of this process to the sulfur cycle has rarely been considered. The chemoattraction of specific marine fauna to algal-derived dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is key in triggering dense, multi-species foraging aggregations that induce iron recycling, augmenting carbon assimilation. The goal of this paper is twofold; first, to highlight DMS chemoattraction as a behavior that catalyzes carbon sequestration via natural iron fertilization, and second, to identify knowledge gaps that recent biogeochemical advances can address. Fostering this interdisciplinary research will enhance our understanding of global climate regulation, ecosystem services provided by marine top predators, and the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, iron, and sulfur in HNLC waters. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon cycle; Community ecology; Dimethyl sulfide; Iron cycle; Marine biogeochemistry; Polar biology; Top predators","biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; catalysis; climate change; community ecology; concentration (composition); dimethylsulfide; ecosystem service; fauna; global climate; marine environment; predator; sulfur; sulfur cycle; Southern Ocean; algae; Cetacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043391104

If 100% of produced water was recycled, per-well water use declined by 25%, reducing threshold exceedance by 10%. Future water stress was predicted to occur in fewer catchments important for drinking water and species of conservation concern due to the decline in new well installations and increased use of recycled water. Accessible and precise withdrawal and streamflow data are critical moving forward to assess and mitigate water stress in streams that experience high-volume withdrawals. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Fracturing fluids; Hydraulic fracturing; Potable water; Recycling; Runoff; Stream flow; Water; Water recycling; Water supply; Aquatic biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Free flowing; Low flow thresholds; Recycled water; Short durations; Threshold exceedance; Water withdrawal; Rivers; drinking water; fresh water; surface water; well water; biodiversity; drinking water; ecosystem service; hydraulic fracturing; pond; risk assessment; streamflow; threshold; water stress; Arkansas; Article; biodiversity; catchment; ecosystem; fracking; natural resource; physiological stress; water stress; dehydration; human; United States; Arkansas; United States; Arkansas; Biodiversity; Dehydration; Ecosystem; Humans; Hydraulic Fracking; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042269692

Crucifer-legume cover crop mixtures could be an effective solution for obtaining these two ecosystem services because they combine advantages of both species. However, crucifers might be a poor companion crop due to their high competition for abiotic resources and a potential allelopathic effect on legumes when grown with them. The aim of our study was to assess performances of a wide range of bispecific crucifer-legume mixtures to provide both catch crop and green manure services. A two-year experiment was conducted at two sites (near Toulouse and Orléans, France) where cultivars from eight crucifer species (rape, white mustard, Indian mustard, Ethiopian mustard, turnip, turnip rape, radish and rocket) and nine legume species (Egyptian clover, crimson clover, common vetch, purple vetch, hairy vetch, pea, soya bean, faba bean, and white lupin) were tested in sole-crop and bispecific mixtures (substitutive design of 50%-50% sole crops). We measured cover crop biomass and N acquisition to assess the soil nitrate catch crop service and N green manure service for the subsequent cash crop. In all experiments, compared to bare soil, crucifer-legume mixtures and crucifer sole cover crops provided the same level of nitrate catch crop service by reducing soil mineral N by an average of 59%, while legume sole cover crops reduced it by at least 35%, which is significant. In addition, within 6 months after termination, crucifer-legume mixtures mineralised more N (mean of 22 kg N ha−1) and thus had a larger N green manure effect for the subsequent cash crop than crucifer sole cover crops (mean of 8 kg N ha−1). This was due to greater N acquisition and a lower C:N ratio of crucifer-legume mixtures; even though crucifers always had advantage in acquiring N, legumes acquired enough N to provide an effective green manure service. These results were consistent in all of our experiments, which represent a wide range of crucifer-legume cover crops, demonstrating their generality. They also demonstrate the compatibility and complementarity of these species when grown together. In conclusion, combining crucifers and legumes as cover crops is an effective solution for obtaining multi-ecosystem services related to N recycling by providing both nitrate catch crop and N green manure services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Brassicaceae; Cover crops; Intercropping; Leguminous; Nitrate catch crop; Nitrogen green manure; Plant interactions","biomass; catch crop; complementarity; cover crop; cultivar; ecosystem service; intercropping; legume; manure; nitrate; Centre-Val de Loire; France; Haute Garonne; Loiret; Midi-Pyrenees; Orleans; Toulouse; Brassicaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035025692

However, relatively little attention has been paid to date to the growing medium of green roofs, i.e., Technosols. A better understanding of the influence of Technosols and the link with ecosystem services is required in order to maximize the environmental benefits of urban rooftop farming. Between March 2013 and March 2015, a pilot project called T4P (Parisian Productive rooftoP, Pilot Experiment) was conducted on the rooftop of AgroParisTech University. Urban organic waste was used, and results were compared with those obtained using a commercial potting soil, based on yield and trace metal concentrations, substrate characterization, and the amount of leaching. An assessment of the ecosystem services expected from the Technosols was undertaken in terms of the output of food (food production and quality), regulation of water runoff (quantity and quality), and the recycling of organic waste. Indicators of these ecosystem services (e.g., yield, annual loss of mass of mineral nitrogen) were identified, measured, and compared with reference cases (asphalt roof, green roof, and cropland). Measured yields were almost equivalent to those obtained from horticultural sources in the same area, and the Technosols also retained 74–84% of the incoming rainfall water. This is the first quantitative analysis of ecosystem services delivered by urban garden rooftops developed on organic wastes, and demonstrates their multifunctional character, as well as allowing the identification of trade-offs. An ecosystem services approach is proposed for the design of soil-based green infrastructure of this kind and more generally for the design of sustainable urban agriculture. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Green roof; Productive rooftop; Technosol; Urban farming; Urban garden; Urban waste","alternative agriculture; ecosystem service; greenspace; organic pollutant; quantitative analysis; recycling; roof; runoff; sustainable development; trace metal; urban area; urban development; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038898809

However, this role is often assumed, with limited or no experimental quantification of its real value. We examined publication trends in the research on ES provided by insects, ascertaining which ES and taxa have been more intensively investigated, and which methodologies have been used, with particular emphasis on experimental approaches. We first performed a systematic literature search to identify which ES have been attributed to insects. Then we classified the references retrieved according to the ES, taxonomic group and ecosystem studied, as well as to the method applied to quantify each ES (in four categories: no quantification, proxies, direct quantification and experiments). Pollination, biological control, food provisioning, and recycling organic matter are the most studied ES. However, the majority of papers do not specify the ES under consideration, and from those that do, most do not quantify the ES provided. From the rest, a large number of publications use proxies as indicators for ES, assuming or inferring their provision through indirect measurements such as species abundances, species density, species richness, diversity indices, or the number of functional groups. Pollinators, predators, parasitoids, herbivores, and decomposers are the most commonly studied functional groups, while Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera are the most studied taxa. Experimental studies are relatively scarce and they mainly focus on biological control, pollination, and decomposition performed in agroecosystems. These results suggest that our current knowledge on the ES provided by insects is relatively scarce and biased, and show gaps in the least-studied functional and taxonomic groups. An ambitious research agenda to improve the empirical and experimental evidence of the role played by insects in ES provision is essential to fully assess synergies between functional ecology, community ecology, and biodiversity conservation under current global changes. © 2017 Gesellschaft für Ökologie","Biological control; Coleoptera; Decomposition; Ecosystem functions; Experimental research; Hymenoptera; Insecta; Nutrient cycling; Pest regulation; Pollination",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035139485

Two of the most important human impacts are excess agricultural nutrient loading in our fresh and estuarine waters and excess carbon dioxide in our oceans and atmosphere. Large-scale global intervention is required to slow, halt, and eventually reverse these stresses. Cultivating attached polyculture algae within controlled open-field photobioreactors is a practical technique for exploiting the ubiquity and high primary productivity of algae to capture and recycle the pollutants driving humanity into unsafe regimes of biogeochemical cycling, ocean acidification, and global warming. Expanded globally and appropriately distributed, algal cultivation is capable of removing excess nutrients from global environments, while additionally sequestering appreciable excess carbon. While obviously a major capital and operational investment, such a project is comparable in magnitude to the construction and maintenance of the global road transportation network. Beyond direct amelioration of critical threats, expanded algal cultivation would produce a major new commodity flow of biomass, potentially useful either as a valuable organic commodity itself, or used to reduce the scale of the problem by improving soils, slowing or reversing the loss of arable land. A 100 year project to expand algal cultivation to completely recycle excess global agricultural N and P would, when fully operational, require gross global expenses no greater than $2.3 × 1012 yr−1, (3.0% of the 2016 global domestic product) and less than 1.9 × 107 ha (4.7 × 107 ac), 0.38% of the land area used globally to grow food.

The global warming potential (GWP) of single operations during a fresh fruit production under local conventional management (Cmng) and the mitigation potential of introducing sustainable management practices (Smng) were assessed. A life cycle assessment analysis (ISO 14067) was performed for the whole life cycle of pilot apricot and peach orchards in Southern Italy (3 sites), taking into account greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions related to all annual agricultural operations, orchard establishment and removal. Results revealed that fertilization shared the highest fraction of GWP (from 22.4% to 60.5%) among all agricultural operations in both Cmng and Smng scenarios. The adoption of Smng had a reduction of GWP ranging from 1% to 17%. When accounting for SOC change (modelled through Roth-C) after the Smng application and for recycling the permanent biomass of trees at the end-of-life of the orchard, the GWP can become negative ranging from approx. −0.8 to −4.2 kg CO2 eq. per ton of fruit. The estimated average mitigation potential of adopting Smng practices was −2.7 t CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1, and derives mostly from soil carbon storage capacity. The adoption of Smng practices could be considered within GHGs mitigation policies for the agricultural sector, if assessed at landscape level.

To adjust to the high environmental performance expected, these systems need to be truly integrated to maximize recycling of nutrients. There are some sophisticated integrations of crop and livestock production systems in temperate regions of the world that are currently unique.

It is intended to ease the non-capital functions of Beijing, optimize regional spatial patterns, and enhance ecosystem services and living environment in this urban agglomeration. Applying multi-stage remote sensing (RS) images, land use/cover change (LUCC) data, ecosystem services assessment data, and high-precision urban land-cover information, we reveal the regional land-cover characteristics of this new district as well as across the planned area of the entire BTH urban agglomeration. Corresponding ecological protection and management strategies are also proposed. Results indicated that built-up areas were rapidly expanding, leading to a continuous impervious surface at high density. Urban and impervious surface areas (ISAs) grew at rates 1.27 and 1.43 times higher than that in the 2000s, respectively, seriously affecting about 15% area of the sub-basins. Construction of XND mainly encompasses Xiongxian, Rongcheng, and Anxin counties, areas which predominantly comprise farmland, townships and rural settlements, water, and wetland ecosystems. The development and construction of XND should ease the non-capital functions of Beijing, as well as moderately control population and industrial growth. Thus, this development should be included within the national ‘sponge city’ construction pilot area in early planning stages, and reference should be made to international low-impact development modes in order to strengthen urban green infrastructural construction. Early stage planning based on the existing characteristics of the underlying surface should consider the construction of green ecological patches and ecological corridors between XND and the cities of Baoding, Beijing, and Tianjin. The proportion of impervious surfaces should not exceed 60%, while that of the core area should not exceed 70%. The development of XND needs to initiate the concept of ‘planning a city according to water resource amount’ and incorporate rainwater collection and recycling. © 2018, Institute of Geographic Science and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration; ecological protection strategies; urban impervious surface; urban land use; Xiong’an New District",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039413390

During the transition from the soil-plant system to the animal, the major biochemical change is the uncoupling of carbon and phosphorus from nitrogen, resulting in dung rich in C and P, urine rich in N and K, or a mixture in the form of manures (slurry, solid manure, compost, etc.). In all these animal returns, C, N, P, and K are more or less labile (from organic to mineral forms) and have the potential to contribute to nutrient losses, recycling, or storage in plant or soil compartments. The dynamics and fate of nutrients depends on their intrinsic properties, as well as on biophysical and management factors (feeding system, animal and herd management, manure management, grassland botanical composition, fertilization, stocking rates) that drive variability and diversity in the size and form of CNPK pools and fluxes, as well as their distribution in space. Here, we explore the nutrient cycle/cascade at different steps (from air-soil to plant-animal to the full air-soil-plant-water-animal system) and at different organizational and spatial scales, i.e., animal and field versus farm or territories. We suggest that a multiscale and multicriteria comparison of the performances of contrasted production systems is necessary to design more sustainable production systems and identify ways to optimize both production and environmental ecosystem services. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Well-managed synergies between crop and livestock production occurring either at the farm scale or at the district scale have the potential to limit environmental problems via, for example, nutrient cycle closure and diversified crop rotations and land uses. However, there is a lack of research using empirical farm data to quantify the actual benefits or drawbacks of crop-livestock integration strategies. Therefore, a farming system approach was used in the “Crops and Animal Together” project (FP7 Project CANTOGETHER) to assess diverse strategies of crop-livestock integration at both farm (10 farms in FR, NL, IT, IE, UK) and district levels (5 districts in ES, IE, FR, NL, CH). The district-level strategies assessed were (1) local exchange of materials among farms (grain, slurry); (2) provision of high-quality forages (cooperative dehydration facility); (3) land exchange between dairy and arable farms; and (4) animal exchanges between lowland and highland regions (heifer rearing). A selection of noncooperating baseline farms (specialized and, where available, mixed) were compared with specialized cooperating farms in each district. Results confirmed that it was the physical integration and complementarity between crops and animals (e.g., home-grown feed, recycling of wastes as fertilizers), not just their coexistence, that was decisive for achieving improved environmental performance at the farm level. Unfortunately, integration at the farm level had the drawbacks of increased workload and reduced productivity and economic performance. At the district level, organization between farms through strategies such as those assessed generally improved productivity and economic performances. However, the potential ecologic benefits of cooperation at district level are restricted by a rebound effect: farmers choosing to use the resources made available via cooperation to intensify their operations as opposed to diversifying them or reducing inputs. In spite of this intensification, cooperation led to environmental benefits by increasing input use efficiency and reducing environmental impacts of farming when expressed per unit of agricultural product produced. An important finding was that territorial cooperation appeared as a key strategy to enable the farms that have implemented a high level of integration between crop and livestock to recover sufficient profitability. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Rapid urbanization and its encroachment on agricultural land is a consequence of increase in population. Between 1950 and 2025, the population (106) would increase from 1.4 to 28.6 (20.4 times) of New Delhi, 4.5 to 20.1 (4.5 times) of Kolkata, 2.9 to 25.8 (8.9 times) of Mumbai, 0.6 to 6.6 (11.0 times) of Pune, 1.1 to 8.9 (8.1 times) of Hyderabad, 0.7 to 9.5 (13.6 times) of Bengaluru, and 1.5 to 9.6 (6.4 times) of Chennai. The city of Mumbai generates 11 thousand Mg of waste per day or 4 million Mg per year, which if recycled effectively, can improve urban and peri-urban agriculture. It takes about 40,000 ha of land to provide accommodation and infrastructure to 1 million people. An annual increase of 11.5 million people in India encroaches upon 0.5 million hectare (Mha) of agricultural land. Thus, there is a strong need to protect prime agricultural land against other uses. By 2025, India will have 7 cities of &gt;10 million people, and a city of 10 million consumes 6000 Mg of food per day. Thus, nutrients brought into the city must be returned to the land by recycling waste as compost and for producing energy. Climate change, with increase in frequency of extreme events, is exacerbating vulnerability of agricultural soils to degradation processes. Land area (Mha) in India already affected by degradation includes 93.7 by water erosion, 9.5 by wind erosion, 14.3 by waterlogging, 5.9 by salinity/alkalinity, 16.0 by soil acidity and 7.4 by complex problems. In addition to the impacts of changing and uncertain climate, soil degradation is exacerbated by burning of crop residues, use of cow dung for household cooking rather than as manure, uncontrolled grazing, unbalanced use of fertilizers, and other extractive farming practices. The drought-food syndrome, caused by water misuse and mismanagement, adversely affects agronomic productivity and wellbeing of millions of people despite the fact that India receives 4000 km 3 of annual precipitation.

However, evidence on BEF relationships in natural ecosystems is still limited, especially for large vertebrates. Here, we aimed to disentangle the relative roles of species richness, composition and abundance of vertebrate scavenger communities in the ecological process of carcass elimination, a pivotal ecosystem service, in natural ecosystems. We evaluated the variability in the scavenging function across ecosystems, and examined the factors explaining it. Location: Nine natural ecosystems, seven in Europe and two in Africa. Major taxa studied: Vertebrates. Time period: 2006–2013. Methods: We obtained BEF relationships from vertebrate scavengers consuming ungulate carcasses monitored through motion-triggered remote cameras. We used the Price equation to tease out the relative roles of species richness, composition and abundance in the scavenging efficiency of vertebrates. Results: We recorded 46 vertebrate scavenging species, 30 in Spain and 16 in South Africa. Two main patterns drove BEF relationships. Species richness and composition drove carcass consumption in ecosystems where functionally dominant scavengers were rare, whilst context dependent effects (including species abundance) did so where functionally dominant species were common. Contrastingly to previous studies, abundance fluctuations in vertebrate scavengers were not exclusively related to common species but to the specialization of obligate scavengers (i.e., Gyps vultures) to rapidly gather at carcasses and to the top-down control exerted by large predators. Main conclusions: Rare and threatened species such as vultures and top predators become functionally key species in scavenging processes, highlighting that the delivery of ecosystem services still stands as a general argument for biodiversity conservation in vertebrate communities. Human persecution of vultures and top predators worldwide is expected to alter ecosystem functioning and services such as nutrient recycling or disease control. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biodiversity loss; biodiversity–ecosystem functioning; large vertebrates; threatened species; top predators; vultures","biodiversity; ecosystem service; predator; raptor; rare species; relative abundance; scavenger; scavenging (feeding); species richness; taxonomy; Africa; Europe; Gyps; Ungulata; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034093576

In this paper, we define “urban ecological infrastructure” and propose an integrated framework in which the infrastructure network provides ecosystem services and sustainable urban systems despite changing landscapes and climate. We define the urban ecological infrastructure (UEI) as an organic integration of blue (water-based), green (vegetated), and grey (non-living) landscapes, combined with exits (outflows, treatment, or recycling) and arteries (corridors), at an ecosystem scale. The UEI framework represents the biotic and abiotic interactions within an ecosystem, and stresses an integrated relationship between artificial and natural systems. It links the grey, blue, and green infrastructures, and integrates them via both exits and arteries. Its insights can help to improve the circulation and reuse of resources throughout the urban ecosystem. This comprehensive conceptual framework can facilitate more rational urban development, and can improve urban ecosystem services and regional sustainability. Although understanding the form and function of UEIs is an important first step, innovative strategies are needed to address challenging obstacles such as rigid thinking, institutional fragmentation and inflexible policies. New thinking and innovative ways of acting will be required to provide a more resilient, stable, and sustainable urban system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Environmental management; Sustainability; Urban ecological infrastructure; Urbanization","Ecology; Environmental management; Refuse disposal; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Water recycling; Conceptual frameworks; Ecosystem services; Infrastructure networks; Integrated frameworks; Regional sustainability; Sustainable urban systems; Urban ecological infrastructure; Urbanization; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959497903

Urban ecological infrastructure (UEI) is the main carrier of ecosystem services in urban areas and provides a promising approach to combat such urban challenges and at the same time increases urban sustainability and resilience. The objectives of this special volume (SV) were to provide systematic reviews and discussions of the new governance, engineering and technologies available for improving UEI, which can be used to promote the development application of improved urban ecological engineering theories, methods and tools. Seven themes are included in this SV: (1) From civil infrastructure to ecological infrastructure: diagnoses and remedies of urban illnesses; (2) International experiences and lessons in urban “green-blue” ecological engineering to develop and to enforce standards for restoration of natural and social ecosystem services; (3) Implementation of integrated urban waste management, recycling and treatment policies and facilities; (4) Design and modify urban impervious surfaces through ecological engineering; (5) Urban aorta ecology, ecological mobility and livable corridors; (6) Integrative design criteria and cases of urban ecological infrastructure management; (7) The roles of urban ecological infrastructure in industrial parks and industrial clusters. This SV included forty-one, high-quality papers on theories and practices in UEI and in urban sustainability. Concepts, principles, theories, innovative assessment models, successful experiences, barriers to and enablers of UEI implementation were discussed. The authors provide a solid foundation and foster new inspiration to catalyze more ecologically sound and sustainable urbanization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Impervious surfaces; Urban ecological infrastructure; Urban transport; Waste management; Wetlands","Biodiversity; Ecology; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Industrial waste treatment; Standards; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Waste management; Waste treatment; Wetlands; Ecosystem services; Engineering and technology; Impervious surface; Infrastructure managements; International experiences; Urban ecological infrastructure; Urban impervious surfaces; Urban transport; Urban transportation",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009827058

However, few such studies assess the role of species interactions, particularly under alternative environmental scenarios, despite interactions being key to ecosystem functioning. Here we address five questions of central importance to ecosystem multifunctionality using a terrestrial animal system. (1) Does the contribution of individual species differ for different ecosystem functions? (2) Do inter-species interactions affect the delivery of single functions and multiple functions? (3) Does the community composition that maximizes individual functions also maximize multifunctionality? (4) Is the functional role of individual species, and the effect of interspecific interactions, modified by changing environmental conditions? (5) How do these roles and interactions change under varying scenarios where ecosystem services are weighted to reflect different societal preferences? We manipulated species' relative abundance in dung beetle communities and measured 16 functions contributing to dung decomposition, plant productivity, nutrient recycling, reduction of greenhouse gases, and microbial activity. Using the multivariate diversity-interactions framework, we assessed how changes in species identity, composition, and interspecific interactions affected these functions in combination with an environmental driver (increased precipitation). This allowed us to identify key species and interactions across multiple functions. We then developed a desirability function approach to examine how individual species and species mixtures contribute to a desired state of overall ecosystem functioning. Species contributed unequally to individual functions, and to multifunctionality, and individual functions were maximized by different community compositions. Moreover, the species and interactions important for maintaining overall multifunctionality depended on the weight given to individual functions. Optimal multifunctionality was context-dependent, and sensitive to the valuation of services. This combination of methodological approaches allowed us to resolve the interactions and indirect effects among species that drive ecosystem functioning, revealing how multiple aspects of biodiversity can simultaneously drive ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight the importance of a multifunctionality perspective for a complete assessment of species' functional contributions. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","biodiversity; complementarity; desirability function approach; dominance; dung beetle; ecosystem function; ecosystem services; environmental perturbation; extinction scenarios; multifunctionality; multivariate diversity-interaction model; species interactions","animal; beetle; biodiversity; ecosystem; feces; female; plant; Animals; Biodiversity; Coleoptera; Ecosystem; Feces; Female; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038888884

For the period 1961–2010, we estimate forest evaporation at a high spatial resolution level and attribute total water consumption to various forest products, including ecosystem services. Global water consumption for roundwood production increased by 25% over 50 years to 961 × 109 m3/y (96% green; 4% blue) in 2001–2010. The water footprint per m3 of wood is significantly smaller in (sub)tropical forests compared to temperate/boreal forests, because (sub)tropical forests host relatively more value next to wood production in the form of other ecosystem services. In terms of economic water productivity and energy yield from bio-ethanol per unit of water, roundwood is rather comparable with major food, feed and energy crops. Recycling of wood products could effectively reduce the water footprint of the forestry sector, thereby leaving more water available for the generation of other ecosystem services. Intensification of wood production can only reduce the water footprint per unit of wood if the additional wood value per ha outweighs the loss of value of other ecosystem services, which is often not the case in (sub)tropical forests. The results of this study contribute to a more complete picture of the human appropriation of water, thus feeding the debate on water for food or feed versus energy and wood. © 2017 The Authors","Bioenergy; Ecosystem services; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Timber; Water consumption","Crops; Ecology; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Lumber; Timber; Tropics; Water management; Water recycling; Water supply; Wood; Wood products; Bio-energy; Ecosystem services; Forest products; Forestry sector; High spatial resolution; Roundwood production; Water consumption; Water productivity; Pulp; bioenergy; ecosystem service; evapotranspiration; forestry; timber; water footprint; water use; wood; Ecosystems; Evaporation; Forests; Fuels; Paper; Transpiration; Tropical Atmospheres; Water Consumption; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019589412

With the progressive shift from a burned to a nonburned harvest system, most of the straw presently retained on the soil surface has become economically viable feedstock for bioenergy production. The trade-offs between the need to preserve soil quality and produce more bioenergy have been the subject of intense discussion. This study presents a synthesis of available information on the magnitude of the main impacts of straw removal from sugarcane fields for bioenergy production and therefore represents an easily available resource to guide management decisions on the recommended amount of straw to be maintained on the field to take advantage of the agronomic, environmental, and industrial benefits. Crop residues remaining on sugarcane fields provide numerous ecosystem services including nutrient recycling, soil biodiversity, water storage, carbon accumulation, control of soil erosion, and weed infestation. Furthermore, several studies reported higher sugarcane production under straw retention on the field, while few suggest that straw may jeopardize biomass production in cold regions and under some specific soil conditions. Pest control is among the parameters favored by straw removal, while N2O emissions are increased only if straw is associated with the application of N fertilizer and vinasse. An appropriate recommendation, which is clearly site specific, should be based on a minimum mass of straw on the field to provide those benefits. Overall, this review indicates that most of the agronomic and environmental benefits are achieved when at least 7 Mg ha−1 of dry straw is maintained on the soil surface. However, modeling efforts are of paramount importance to assess the magnitude and rates of straw removal considering the several indicators involved in this complex equation, so that an accurate straw recovery rate could be provided to producers and industry toward greater sustainability. © 2016 The Authors Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2G bioethanol; bioelectricity; bioenergy; Saccharum spp.; soil management; soil quality; sugarcane trash; sugarcane yield; sustainability","Agricultural wastes; Agronomy; Biodiversity; Bioelectric phenomena; Biomass; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Electrophysiology; Information management; Soils; Sustainable development; Water recycling; Weed control; Bio-energy; Saccharum spp; Soil management; Soil quality; Sugarcane yield; Soil conservation; agronomy; bioenergy; crop residue; ecosystem service; environmental impact; ethanol; literature review; soil conservation; soil management; soil quality; soil surface; straw; sugar cane; sustainability; Brazil",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007198752

It is intended to ease the non-capital functions of Beijing, optimize regional spatial patterns, and enhance ecosystem services and living environment in this urban agglomeration. Applying multi- stage remote sensing (RS) images, land use/cover change (LULC) data, ecosystem services assessment data, and highprecision urban land-cover information, we reveal the regional land-cover characteristics of this new district as well as across the planned area of the entire BTH urban agglomeration. Corresponding ecological protection and management strategies are also proposed. Results indicated that built-up areas were rapidly expanding, leading to a continuous impervious surface at high density. Urban and impervious surface areas (ISAs) grew at rates 1.27 and 1.43 times higher than that in 2000, respectively, seriously affecting about 15% area of the subbasins. Construction of XND mainly encompasses Xiongxian, Rongcheng, and Anxin counties, areas which predominantly comprise farmland, townships and rural settlements, water, and wetland ecosystems. The development and construction of XND should ease the non-capital functions of Beijing, as well as moderately control population and industrial growth. Thus, this development should be included within the national 'sponge city' construction pilot area in early planning stages, and reference should be made to international low-impact development modes in order to strengthen urban green infrastructural construction. Early stage planning based on the existing characteristics of the underlying surface should consider the construction of green ecological patches and ecological corridors between XND and the cities of Baoding, Beijing, and Tianjin. The proportion of impervious surfaces should not exceed 60%, while that of the core area should not exceed 70%. The development of XND needs to initiate the concept of 'planning a city according to water resource amount' and incorporate rainwater collection and recycling. © 2017, Science Press.

India’s food grain production of 273.4 million tonnes (Mt) in 2017 has to be increased from lesser arable land area, lower fertilizer use and reduced consumption of water for supplementary irrigation. Furthermore, degraded soils, affecting land area of 114.2 million hectare (Mha), must be restored and risks of any new soil degradation minimized. In this context, the importance of recycling bio-wastes (e.g., agricultural, municipal and industrial) to restore soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration and stock and improve soil health cannot be over-emphasized. Crop residues, 510-836 Tg yr-1. are a major source of C, plant nutrients, biofuels and industrial raw materials. Rather than in-field burning and used as traditional fuel, composting and using as mulch can reduce risks of erosion and improve soil health. Similarly, dung production in India, also a rich source of C and nutrients, must be recycled as manure and used in bioreactors to produce methane. Wasted grains, fruits and vegetables must also be composted and used as a soil amendments. Judicious use of bio-wastes can re-carbonize the biosphere, restore degraded soils and improve soil health, produce biofuels and other value addition industrial byproducts, and improve the environment. Conservative estimates of additional soil C sequestration by judicious management of crop residues and animal dung are 24 Tg C yr-1 worth US 3.0 billion of revenue for farmers and land managers from payments for ecosystem services. There is a strong need of enhancing the awareness about proper disposal and use of bio-wastes through environmental education in primary and secondary schools, and communication by IT services. Recycling of bio-wastes is also critical to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals of the U.N. (Agenda 2030), promoting “4 per Thousand” program of COP21, and upholding the “Swatchh Bharat” ideals. It is a win-win-win option. © 2018, IndianJournals.com.

Given the world population growth and the increasing demand in fat for food and fuel, the increase in oil palm production is expected to continue. It is thus important to find ways of reducing the ecological impact of oil palm plantations at both the agroecosystem and the mill supply area levels, by improving agricultural practices and land uses. This is where agroecology can play a very critical role. The present article gathers short stories on agroecological practices currently taking place in oil palm plantations in South-East Asia. Such stories notably highlight the importance of the various palm co-products and how appropriate recycling strategies can allow for reducing external inputs to both the field and the mill. Besides limiting environmental impacts thanks to such savings, several co-products used as organic amendments can even help to maintain or enhance soil quality. Other stories explored agroecological practices developed for biological controls. Although integrated pest management has been applied in palm plantations for a long time, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully deciphered and practices still need to be improved. More knowledge is needed in order to better account for the holistic role of biodiversity and arbitrate trade-offs between practices and ecosystem services, at both plantation and landscape levels. © C.

Information on the impact of management practices adopted in fruit tree crops on ES is fragmented and often not fully codified. This paper focuses on some Mediterranean fruit tree crops i.e. peach (Prunus persica), apricot (Prunus armeniaca), olive (Olea europaea) groves and vineyards (Vitis vinifera), and links mainly soil processes and functions to the provisioning, regulating and sociocultural ES. The effects of field practices (e.g., tillage/no-tillage, cover crops, retention/burning of pruning residues, mineral/organic fertilization) on manageable soil properties (e.g., porosity, organic carbon content, composition of microbial community) and related functions (e.g., supply of nutrients, water storage, soil stability, above-ground biodiversity) were examined. The analysis draws the attention to the pivotal role of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks on soil aggregates and erodibility, soil water storage, use of fresh water for irrigation, plant nutrition, biodiversity, nutrient storage and absorption of pesticides. Sociocultural services delivered by tree crops are also discussed. This paper highlights the dependence of ES on the sustainable field practices adopted, particularly those aimed at increasing SOC stocks (e.g., no tillage, increased carbon input, recycling of pruning residuals, cover crops). The outcomes presented may strengthen the significance of increasing SOC management practices for fruit tree crops and be supportive of the implementation of environmentally friendly policies assisting in the conservation or the improvement of the soil natural capital. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric CO2 removal; Biodiversity; Erosion; Management practices; Nutrients; Soil aggregates; Water storage","agricultural management; biodiversity; carbon dioxide; crop plant; deciduous tree; ecosystem service; field method; fruit set; management practice; Mediterranean environment; nutrient dynamics; orchard; organic carbon; pollutant removal; soil aggregate; soil carbon; soil erosion; soil water; vineyard; water storage; Olea europaea; Prunus armeniaca; Prunus persica; Vitis vinifera",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010441028

We focused on the interactive effects of NPK fertilization, mowing, and removal of the initially dominant species (Molinia caerulea) on plant, soil, and microbial responses in wet oligotrophic grassland in a 16-year full-factorial manipulative experiment. Changes in vegetation composition, soil pH, and nutrient availability were accompanied by altered microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition, whereas treatment effects on soil microbial biomass and carbon (C) mineralization were mainly related to changes in soil organic matter (SOM) content and nutrient availability. Fertilization decreased plant species richness aboveground and lowered SOM storage and microbial activity belowground. Mowing preserved high plant diversity and led to more efficient recycling of N within the grassland, whereas Molinia removal significantly affected only plant community composition. Mowing combined with fertilization maintained high species richness only in the short term. Belowground, mowing reduced N leaching from the fertilized system but did not prevent SOM depletion, soil acidification, and concomitant adverse effects on soil microbes. We conclude that annual mowing is the appropriate type of extensive management for oligotrophic species-rich meadows, but the concomitant nutrient depletion should not be compensated for by regular NPK fertilization due to its adverse effects on soil quality. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","dominant removal; fertilization; grassland; microbial community structure; mowing; pH; PLFA","aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; dominance; ecosystem service; fatty acid; fertilizer application; grass; leaching; meadow; microbial community; mowing; nutrient availability; pH; removal experiment; soil organic matter; species richness; temperate environment; Molinia; Molinia caerulea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984833779

How the evolution of such strategies modifies ecosystem functioning and services is still not well understood. In the present work, we aim at understanding how the evolution of different phenotypic traits link aboveground and belowground processes, thereby affecting the functioning of the ecosystem at different scales and in different realms. Using a simple model, we follow the dynamics of a limiting nutrient inside an ecosystem. Considering trade-offs between aboveground and belowground functional traits, we study the effects of the evolution of such strategies on ecosystem properties (amount of mineral nutrient, total plant biomass, dead organic matter, and primary productivity) and whether such properties are maximized. Our results show that when evolution leads to a stable outcome, it minimizes the quantity of nutrient available (following Tilman’s R* rule). We also show that considering the evolution of aboveground and belowground functional traits simultaneously, total plant biomass and primary productivity are not necessarily maximized through evolution. The coupling of aboveground and belowground processes through evolution may largely diminish predicted standing biomass and productivity (extinction may even occur) and impact the evolutionary resilience (i.e., the return time to previous phenotypic states) of the ecosystem in the face of external disturbances. We show that changes in plant biomass and their effects on evolutionary change can be understood by accounting for the links between nutrient uptake and mineralization, and for indirect effects of nutrient uptake on the amount of detritus in the system. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Belowground-aboveground interactions; Ecosystem functioning; Nutrient cycling; Plant evolution; Tilman’s R* rule","aboveground production; belowground production; biomass; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; evolution; nutrient cycling; nutrient uptake; phenotype; plant; primary production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992727452

While emergent species take up nutrients from the sediment, submerged and floating macrophytes filter nutrients directly from the surface water, which may be more efficient in constructed wetlands. It remains unclear, however, whether their efficiency is sufficient for wastewater purification and how plant species and nutrient loading affects nutrient distribution over plants, water and sediment. We therefore determined nutrient removal efficiencies of different vegetation (Azolla filiculoides, Ceratophyllum demersum and Myriophyllum spicatum) and sediment types (clay, peaty clay and peat) at three nutrient input rates, in a full factorial, outdoor mesocosm experiment. At low loading (0.43 mg Pm-2 d-1/, plant uptake was the main pathway (100 %) for phosphorus (P) removal, while sediments showed a net P release. A. filiculoides and M. spicatum showed the highest biomass production and could be harvested regularly for nutrient recycling, whereas C. demersum was outcompeted by spontaneously developing macrophytes and algae. Higher nutrient loading only stimulated A. filiculoides growth. At higher rates (≥21.4 mg Pm-2 d-1), 50-90% of added P ended up in sediments, with peat sediments becoming more easily saturated. For nitrogen (N), 45-90% was either taken up by the sediment or lost to the atmosphere at loadings ≥62 mgNm-2 d-1. This shows that aquatic macrophytes can indeed function as an efficient nutrient filter but only for low loading rates (polishing) and not for high rates (purification). The outcome of this controlled study not only contributes to our understanding of nutrient dynamics in constructed wetlands but also shows the differential effects of wetland sediment types and plant species. Furthermore, the acquired knowledge may benefit the application of macrophyte harvesting to remove and recycle nutrients from both constructed wetlands and nutrient-loaded natural wetlands. © Author(s) 2017.",,"aquatic organism; constructed wetland; ecosystem service; macrophyte; mesocosm; nutrient cycling; nutrient dynamics; pollutant removal; purification; surface water; wastewater; algae; Azolla filiculoides; Ceratophyllum demersum; Myriophyllum spicatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013347198

We present advances for LCA that integrate spatially explicit modelling of land change and ecosystem services in a Land-Use Change Improved (LUCI)-LCA. Comparing increased demand for bioplastics derived from two alternative feedstock-location scenarios for maize and sugarcane, we find that the LUCI-LCA approach yields results opposite to those of standard LCA for greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, and of different magnitudes for soil erosion and biodiversity.

Recovery of secondary resources plays a significant role. Industrial processes developed to regain minerals for commodity production in a circular economy become ever more important in the European Union and worldwide. Landfill mining (LFM) constitutes an important technological toolset of processes that regain resources and redistribute them with an accompanying reduction of hazardous influence of environmental contamination and other threats for human health hidden in former dump sites and landfills. This review paper is devoted to LFM problems, historical development and driving paradigms of LFM from ‘classical hunting for valuables’ to ‘perspective in ecosystem revitalization’. The main goal is to provide a description of historical experience and link it to more advanced concept of a circular economy.

These ecological functions ultimately support the ecosystem services upon which humanity depends. Despite hundreds of experimental tests of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function (BEF), it remains unclear whether diversity effects are sufficiently general that we can use a single relationship to quantitatively predict how changes in species richness alter an ecosystem function across trophic levels, ecosystems and ecological conditions. Our objective here is to determine whether a general relationship exists between biodiversity and standing biomass. We used hierarchical mixed effects models, based on a power function between species richness and biomass production (Y = a × Sb), and a database of 374 published experiments to estimate the BEF relationship (the change in biomass with the addition of species), and its associated uncertainty, in the context of environmental factors. We found that the mean relationship (b = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.37) characterized the vast majority of observations, was robust to differences in experimental design, and was independent of the range of species richness levels considered. However, the richness–biomass relationship varied by trophic level and among ecosystems; in aquatic systems b was nearly twice as large for consumers (herbivores and detritivores) compared to primary producers; in terrestrial ecosystems, b for detritivores was negative but depended on few studies. We estimated changes in biomass expected for a range of changes in species richness, highlighting that species loss has greater implications than species gains, skewing a distribution of biomass change relative to observed species richness change. When biomass provides a good proxy for processes that underpin ecosystem services, this relationship could be used as a step in modeling the production of ecosystem services and their dependence on biodiversity. © 2016 The Authors",,"aquatic ecosystem; biodiversity; biomass; ecological modeling; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; environmental factor; experimental design; primary production; skewness; species richness; terrestrial ecosystem; trophic level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992472440

The Baltic Sea Region (BSR) has a great bioenergy potential worth exploring in this context. This paper explores the state-of-art of bioenergy systems and synergies with eco-systems services in the BSR region in the context of developing the region's bio-economy. In this brief assessment, we consider 8 countries (i.e. Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Denmark, and Belarus) in the region. While the production and use of modern bioenergy can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, promote energy security, diversify energy resources, and contribute to a successful circular economy and rural development, it is important to find a balance between the exploration of resources and the management of eco-systems services. In addition, both climate change vulnerability and bioenergy production may affect the environment and the capacity of the BSR to deliver ecosystem services (ESS). We recommend integrated strategies for optimal use of bioresources in the region. Bioeconomy can be realized by innovative approaches, establishing cross-cutting institutional and policy linkages for increased prosperity and green growth in the Baltic Sea Region. ©2017 The Authors.

Resource limitation, climate, leading to increasing water scarcity, demographic and socio-institutional shifts promote more integrated water management, such as: storm-water harvesting and re-use that may mitigate the risk of water restrictions for urban populations. There is a need to ascertain whether integrated strategies can achieve social and economic goals as well as good-quality ecosystem service and maintenance by long-term monitoring of existing reuse plant, design and feasibility analysis and probabilistic modelling of sustainable rainfall drainage, storage and re-use systems. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems may supply daily non-potable water for irrigation, toilette flushing, car washing and other uses. Optimal storage capacity size should correspond to that tank size for which further increases in size produced only a small increase in reliability. Design is usually performed with reference to tank efficiency, and previous studies evidenced how only in high-demanding scenarios there will be a marked dependence of the RWH system efficiency on the water demand. In this study, data taken from literature, and referred to many different place in the world, are re-examined in light of a new risk model. Efficiency, risk of overflow and risk of waterscarcity of RWH tank are examined under various climatic and operational scenarios (including system size and demand). Efficiency is compared with risk and their suitability as indicators of correct tank design is discussed. © 2017 WIT Press.",,"Climate change; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Flow of water; Harvesting; Land use; Population statistics; Potable water; Rain; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Tanks (containers); Water management; Water supply; Feasibility analysis; Integrated water management; Long term monitoring; Operational scenario; Probabilistic modelling; Rainwater harvesting; Rainwater harvesting system; Resource limitations; Water conservation; ecosystem service; efficiency measurement; precipitation (climatology); rainwater; recycling; reliability analysis; urban population; water demand; water management; water storage; water supply; water use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008467277

The Liyashan oyster reef is located inshore of Dongzhao Port, Haimen County, Jiangsu Province, China. However, the natural intertidal oyster reef is rapidly degrading due to high sedimentation, habitat loss, and overfishing, with its area reduced by 30% during 2003-2013. To protect the important biogenic reef, a restoration project was initiated in 2013-2014. We recycled 100 tons of oyster shells (≥ 6 months) from the oyster aquaculture zone in Xiangshan Bay as substrate (cultch) for oyster larval setting, where 16000 nylon bags (diameter: 20 cm, height: 50 cm, mesh: 2 cm) were filled with old oyster shells. In early July 2013, the oyster shells were placed in the Liyashan waters, creating a habitat for young oysters to attach and grow to ensure their abundance. We constructed 53 small reefs (24 single-layer reefs[SLR] and 29 multi-layer reefs[MLR]) at five restoration sites within the Liyashan area. Oyster abundance was significantly higher in MLR than in SLR at each of the four sampling periods, but showed a significant decline with reef development. The mean shell height of oysters in the restored reef significantly increased during two periods (from September to November 2013, and March to May 2014) (Kruskal-Wallis test, Q=10.519,Q=6.527,P<0.05), but oysters stopped growing in the overwintering period (Nov 2013 to March 2014) (Q=0.35,P>0.05). Forty-one species of resident benthic macrofauna were recorded at the restored reefs. Although there were few changes in species richness, the mean density and biomass showed significant increases with reef development that were similar to the adjacent natural oyster reef, but significantly higher than at the non-restored zone. The mean total density and biomass of benthic communities were 5.1 and 3.1 times higher, respectively, at restored than at non-restored reefs.MDS plots showed that resident benthic communities differed significantly between the restored and adjacent natural reefs (ANOSIM, P=0.001), which were mainly attributed to higher densities of sipunculid worms (Phascolosoma esculenta), rock snails (Thais luteostoma), polychaete worms (Perinereis nuntia), and Asian shore crabs (Hemigrapsus sinensis). Oyster reef restoration in Jiangsu Province was considered to be successful, improving the oyster population, reef area and density, and biomass of resident macrofauna. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

These areas have the potential to be engineered in such a way that they deliver a range of ecosystem services including flood regulation and biodiversity conservation in addition to their primary functions such as comfort of sidewalk users (mostly un-vegetated), protection of spray from passing vehicles, a space for benches, bus shelters, street lights and other public amenities, and visual improvement of the roads and designated green belts. Previous research has shown that in soils, calcium-rich materials such as recycled crushed concrete or natural crushed dolerite undergo carbonation. This effectively captures CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it in the form of CaCO3 precipitated between soil particles. Engineering this process can potentially assist the UK in achieving its ambitious target to reduce CO2 emissions by 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. Rates of carbonation measured at urban brownfield sites in the UK suggest that treating 12,000 hectares of land containing suitable amendments could remove 1 million tonne CO2 annually. However, brownfield sites are often subjected to re-construction activities which would reduce the rate of CO2 absorption from the atmosphere by sealing. To optimize the rate of carbonation, engineered soils need to be constructed at locations subjected to least post-construction activities and roadside verges and central reserves represent a key opportunity in this regard. This paper calculates limits to CaCO3 formation within the first 1 m of pore spaces of soils at roadside verges and central reserves in Britain considering a soil porosity of 20%. © Int.

However, the benefits of sustainable P use and management for society due to its downstream impacts on multiple ecosystem services are rarely acknowledged. We propose a conceptual framework—the “phosphorus‐ecosystem services cascade” ()—to integrate the key ecosystem processes and functions that moderate the relationship between P released to the environment from human actions and ecosystem services at distinct spatial and temporal scales. Indirect pathways in the cascade via soil and aquatic processes link anthropogenic P to biodiversity and multiple services, including recreation, drinking water provision, and fisheries. As anthropogenic P cascades through catchments, it often shifts from a subsidy to a stressor of ecosystem services. Phosphorus stewardship can have emergent ecosystem service co‐benefits due to synergies with other societal or management goals (e.g., recycling of livestock manures and organic wastes could impact soil carbon storage). Applying the framework, we identify key research priorities to align P stewardship with the management of multiple ecosystem services, such as incorporating additional services into agri‐environmental P indices, assessing how widespread recycling of organic P sources could differentially impact agricultural yields and water quality, and accounting for shifting baselines in P stewardship due to climate change. Ultimately, P impacts depend on site‐specific agricultural and biogeophysical contexts, so greater precision in targeting stewardship strategies to specific locations would help to optimize for ecosystem services and to more effectively internalize the downstream costs of farm nutrient management. © 2016, © 2016 MacDonald et al.","agriculture; ecosystem services; phosphorus; sustainability; water quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021306236

In this avenue, there is a need to advance holistic approaches and objective tools which allow policy makers to better evaluate system-level properties and trade-offs of water resources. This research contributes to the expanding literature in this area by examining the changes to system-level network configurations of the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin from 2000 to 2009. Specifically, through the ecological network analysis (ENA) approach, this research examines changes to the system-level properties of efficiency, redundancy, and evaluates the trade-offs to the resiliency of ecosystem water services of the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin. Our results indicate that while the efficiency of the middle reaches has increased from 2000 to 2009 by 6% and 78% more water is released to the lower reaches, the redundancy of the system has also decreased by 6%. The lower level of redundancy, particularly due to the changes in the groundwater body levels, has critical long-term consequences for the resilience of the water ecosystem services of the middle reaches. In consideration of these holistic trade-offs, two hypothetical alternative scenarios, based on water recycling and saving strategies, are developed to improve the long-term health and resilience of the water system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological network analysis; Heihe River basin; Resilience; Sustainability; Water resource management","Commerce; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Natural resources management; Redundancy; Resource allocation; Rivers; Sustainable development; Water management; Water recycling; Watersheds; Critical challenges; Ecological network analysis; Groundwater bodies; Heihe river basin; Network configuration; Resilience; Sustainable management; Waterresource management; Water resources; ground water; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; environmental policy; network analysis; resource management; sustainability; sustainable development; water resource; analytic method; Article; ecological network analysis; ecosystem resilience; policy; priority journal; recycling; river basin; trend study; water flow; water management; water supply; China; Gansu; Hei River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994056255

It has protected meristems, a strong root system and flexible leaves which enable it to grow under strong tidal conditions as well as tolerate periods of exposure and desiccation characteristic of the intertidal zone. Estuaries with the largest areas of Z. capensis are Olifants, Langebaan, Berg, Knysna, Keurbooms, Swartkops and Bushmans. Only Langebaan and Knysna have some formal protection status. Large populations were lost from KwaZulu-Natal estuaries at the time of Durban Bay harbour development in the 1950s and more recently from St Lucia. There have been a number of studies in South Africa showing the utilisation of eelgrass beds by a variety of invertebrate and fish species for habitat, shelter, foraging sites and nurseries. Fewer studies have addressed nutrient recycling and other ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. In all estuaries the distribution of Z. capensis is highly dynamic and therefore difficult to map, assess changes over time and use as an indicator of estuary health. Cover and biomass are removed after large floods and have been shown to fluctuate in response to bait digging and disturbance by boats. This review identifies eutrophication as an emerging threat that encourages macroalgal growth, which smothers Z. capensis. Despite its wide distribution range, Z. capensis is sensitive to human impacts which have led to the species being listed as vulnerable in the Red Data List. It is encouraging that approximately 46% of all estuaries with Z. capensis have estuary management plans as these strive to protect sensitive habitats using activity zoning. Studies tracking the changes over time of the Z. capensis beds in specific estuaries are needed to understand dynamic responses. In addition there is urgency for a national assessment of the distribution and health of this keystone species in South Africa. © 2016 South African Association of Botanists","Eelgrass; Floods; Keystone; Submerged macrophytes","anthropogenic effect; carbon sequestration; desiccation; dynamic response; ecosystem health; ecosystem service; eutrophication; flood; geographical distribution; intertidal environment; keystone species; macrophyte; Red List; seagrass; species conservation; submerged vegetation; South Africa; Invertebrata; Zostera capensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996490644

Today, Dublin Port is the busiest port in Ireland, handling 31 million tonnes of cargo a year and over 1.6 million ferry passengers and covering an area of 260 hectares in the centre of Dublin Bay, which encloses an area of about 296km2. Close to the port there are wetlands that are home to internationally important populations of birds and a range of coastal, intertidal and subtidal habitats, many of which are protected under EU and other legislation. The bay has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere. Dublin has a population of over a million people. The bay has high cultural value and is extensively used for recreation. There is a power station and a waste water treatment plant close to the port, together with oil storage, scrap metal recycling and cement manufacture. There were some shell and fin-fish fisheries in the past but commercial fishing is very limited today, although there are some important nursery areas for fish species harvested in the Irish Sea. Levels of contaminants have reduced in sediments due to reductions in shipbuilding, although concentrations of PAHs, metals and a range of pesticides are high in some areas. Dublin is a major oil trans-shipment port and oil exploration has been proposed in the bay, so there is risk of further oil contamination. Water quality is generally good, but sewage infrastructure and treatment capacity need further enhancement to sustain recent improvements. Sea level rise will bring increased risk of coastal flooding and threatens some of the wetland habitats. Additional sea-defences will further add to the extent of artificial structures along the foreshore. Dublin Port is set to expand and there are concerns over invasive species and climate change, particularly given lack of knowledge of potential impacts of invaders and the complex combined effects of multiple local and global stressors. Coastal management is currently characterised by a sectoral approach; greater integration is needed. It is beginning to develop, partly due to recent EU directives and stakeholder engagement will be facilitated by the Dublin Bay Biosphere partnership. Having expanded at the expense of the coastal environment, Dublin City and Port are now beginning to reconnect with nature and with people who are increasingly recognising the value of natural capital and ecosystem services. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Climatic change; Culture; Dublin Port; Multiple stressors; Pollution; Threats",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964345537

They recycle nutrients, degrade organic matter and, occasionally, they infect and kill the fish, their larvae or the live feed. Also, some microorganisms may protect fish and larvae against disease. Hence, monitoring and manipulating the microbial communities in aquaculture environments hold great potential; both in terms of assessing and improving water quality, but also in terms of controlling the development of microbial infections. Using microbial communities to monitor water quality and to efficiently carry out ecosystem services within the aquaculture systems may only be a few years away. Initially, however, we need to thoroughly understand the microbiomes of both healthy and diseased aquaculture systems, and we need to determine how to successfully manipulate and engineer these microbiomes. Similarly, we can reduce the need to apply antibiotics in aquaculture through manipulation of the microbiome, i.e. by the use of probiotic bacteria. Recent studies have demonstrated that fish pathogenic bacteria in live feed can be controlled by probiotics and that mortality of infected fish larvae can be reduced significantly by probiotic bacteria. However, the successful management of the aquaculture microbiota is currently hampered by our lack of knowledge of relevant microbial interactions and the overall ecology of these systems. © 2016 The Authors.

Recycling and reuse of both wastewater and greywater are becoming more attractive. The strategy is to protect ecosystem services by balancing the withdrawal of water and the disposal of wastewater. In the present study, a timely and novel synthetic greywater composition has been proposed with respect to the composition of heavy metals, nutrients and organic matter. The change in water quality of the synthetic greywater due to increasing storage time was monitored to evaluate the stability of the proposed chemical formula. The new greywater is prepared artificially using analytical-grade chemicals to simulate either low (LC) or high (HC) pollutant concentrations. The characteristics of the synthetic greywater were tested (just before starting the experiment, after two days and a week of storage under real weather conditions) and compared to those reported for real greywater. Test results for both synthetic greywater types showed great similarities with the physiochemical properties of published findings concerning real greywater. Furthermore, the synthetic greywater is relatively stable in terms of its characteristics for different storage periods. However, there was a significant (p &lt;.05) reduction in 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) for both low (LC) and high (HC) concentrations of greywater after two days of storage with reductions of 62% and 55%, respectively. A significant (p &lt;.05) change was also noted for the reduction (70%) of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concerning HC greywater after seven days of storage. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","contamination; ecosystem; greywater; Sustainability; synthetic greywater","Biochemical oxygen demand; Chemical stability; Contamination; Ecosystems; Heavy metals; Sustainable development; Wastewater disposal; Water conservation; Water quality; Water resources; Analytical grades; Chemical formulae; Chemical simulations; Ecosystem services; Greywater; Physio-chemical properties; Pollutant concentration; Sustainable water resources; Wastewater reclamation; heavy metal; nitrate; nitrogen; organic matter; waste water; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical analysis; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); nitrate; physicochemical property; reduction; simulation; wastewater; water quality; Article; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical analysis; chemical composition; chemical structure; concentration (parameters); controlled study; greywater; membrane reactor; nutrient; reduction; simulation; waste water; water analysis; water and water related phenomena; water pollutant; water pollution; water quality; water supply; weather; chemical model; procedures; recycling; sewage; Models, Chemical; Recycling; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953723132

The region is also a major source of water vapour recycled into continental precipitation through evapotranspiration processes. This review applies an ecohydrological approach to Amazonia's water cycle by looking at contributions of water resources in the context of future agricultural production. At present, agriculture in the region is primarily rain-fed and relies almost exclusively on green-water resources (soil moisture regenerated by precipitation). Future agricultural development, however, will likely follow pathways that include irrigation from blue-water sources (surface water and groundwater) as insurance from variability in precipitation. In this review, we first provide an updated summary of the green-blue ecohydrological framework before describing past trends in Amazonia's water resources within the context of land use and land cover change. We then describe green- and blue-water trade-offs in light of future agricultural production and potential irrigation to assess costs and benefits to terrestrial ecosystems, particularly land and biodiversity protection, and regional precipitation recycling.

In contrast to work addressing the carbon benefits of afforestation, we highlight the potential usefulness of forests as major contributors to the water cycle. Integrating water and carbon cycle benefits into a common objective enhances discussions about the role and value of forests. Herein, we describe a method for increasing regional precipitation in semi-arid environments, thereby potentially helping to increase scarce water resources. The approach capitalizes on observed interactions between forest cover and the hydrologic cycle, with the express aim of returning much needed water resources to an increasingly vulnerable region. The natural processes behind ""precipitation recycling"" (PR), and vegetation based cross continental transport of atmospheric moisture form the core of this solution. Induced precipitation recycling (IPR) initiates these processes by irrigating afforested land using locally available surplus water. This paper discusses the underlying processes and a proposed demonstration project that functions as both a ""proof of concept"" and a research testing ground, providing potential validation for promoting future expansion to the wider region. The proposed IPR project utilizes treated wastewater and surplus storm run-off, thus averting additional burdens on the existing water supply, while performing additionally valuable environmental and ecosystem services. IPR provides an alternative approach to supplement existing and typically far costlier plans to address regional water shortages and handle wastewater treatment. The proposed integrated solution would not only contribute positively to regional water supply, but would also provide additional eco-system services and end-products that add value and utility, thereby improving the project's potential economic viability. This project should be of particular interest to land use and water management planners in the Los Angeles Basin area for whom it is conceived, as well as to those along much of the coastal region in California where climate change-driven drought cycles have been increasing in length and intensity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Afforestation; Drought management; Integrated solutions; Precipitation-recycling; Water management","Atmospheric movements; Climate change; Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Recycling; Reforestation; Vegetation; Wastewater treatment; Water management; Water resources; Water supply; Adaptation; Afforestation; Drought management; Integrated solutions; Precipitation recycling; Water recycling; adaptive management; afforestation; atmospheric moisture; carbon cycle; climate feedback; drought stress; forest ecosystem; hydrological cycle; integrated approach; land use change; vegetation cover; water management; California; Los Angeles Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962555269

However, knowledge of the sustainability of plastic mulching remains vague in terms of both an environmental and agronomic perspective. This review critically discusses the current understanding of the environmental impact of plastic mulch use by linking knowledge of agricultural benefits and research on the life cycle of plastic mulches with direct and indirect implications for long-term soil quality and ecosystem services. Adverse effects may arise from plastic additives, enhanced pesticide runoff and plastic residues likely to fragment into microplastics but remaining chemically intact and accumulating in soil where they can successively sorb agrochemicals. The quantification of microplastics in soil remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate analytical techniques. The cost and effort of recovering and recycling used mulching films may offset the aforementioned benefits in the long term. However, comparative and long-term agronomic assessments have not yet been conducted. Furthermore, plastic mulches have the potential to alter soil quality by shifting the edaphic biocoenosis (e.g. towards mycotoxigenic fungi), accelerate C/N metabolism eventually depleting soil organic matter stocks, increase soil water repellency and favour the release of greenhouse gases. A substantial process understanding of the interactions between the soil microclimate, water supply and biological activity under plastic mulches is still lacking but required to estimate potential risks for long-term soil quality. Currently, farmers mostly base their decision to apply plastic mulches rather on expected short-term benefits than on the consideration of long-term consequences. Future interdisciplinary research should therefore gain a deeper understanding of the incentives for farmers and public perception from both a psychological and economic perspective in order to develop new support strategies for the transition into a more environment-friendly food production. © 2016 .","Biodegradation; Ecological transformation; Ecosystem services; Microplastics; Plasticulture; Soil organic matter dynamics","Additives; Agricultural chemicals; Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Bioactivity; Biodegradation; Biogeochemistry; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Microplastic; Organic compounds; Risk perception; Soil moisture; Soil quality; Sustainable development; Water supply; Ecological transformation; Ecosystem services; Microplastics; Plasticulture; Soil organic matter dynamics; Biodegradable polymers; metal; organic matter; pesticide; phthalic acid; plastic; polyethylene; plastic; soil; soil pollutant; agricultural application; biodegradation; ecosystem service; environmental impact assessment; mulching; plastic; soil degradation; soil organic matter; strategic approach; agriculture; agroecosystem; agronomic benefit; awareness; biodegradation; carbon metabolism; cost benefit analysis; environmental parameters; greenhouse gas; landscape; life cycle; nitrogen metabolism; organism community; plastic mulching; priority journal; Review; soil degradation; soil moisture; soil porosity; soil property; soil quality; soil stability; water transport; agriculture; analysis; chemistry; ecosystem; environment; procedures; soil; soil pollutant; Fungi; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Environment; Pesticides; Plastics; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957590381

However, the impacts of golf courses on local environment, including ecosystem services and dis-services are not clearly understood. To explore this relationship, we took two golf courses in Beijing (a links course and a parkland course) to develop an assessment framework and present estimates of economic values of net ecosystem services, in aspects of ecosystem goods, carbon fixation, soil retention, flood storage, recreation, water consumption and nonpoint-source pollution. The results showed that the two golf courses have provided remarkable net ecosystem services values (links 51.58 × 104 yuan/ha/yr, parkland 42.60 × 104 yuan/ha/yr, 6.19 yuan = 1 US$ in 2013). Over 95% of this value is generated by three services: recreation, ecosystem goods and flood storage. Our results indicate that the parkland course has better performance in sustainable supply of ecosystem services than the links course. In addition, this study provides useful improvements for golf course design and management concerning positive environmental externalities optimizing, including the scaling of non-playing areas to maximize golf course ecosystem services supply capacity, appropriate grass species selecting and irrigation with recycled water. Moreover, a policy analysis suggests that the development of public golf course in China is a necessary complement to resolve the mismatch between private and public benefits and let more people enjoy the ecosystem services. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of short-term and small-scale experimental studies are both equivocal and difficult to extrapolate from. In this study we use data on benthic palaeocommunities covering 4,000,000 years (in the Late Jurassic when temperate coastal seas in NW Europe experienced fluctuations in oxygenation). The biological traits associated with each species in the palaeocommunities were combined to index the delivery of ecological functions. Five ecosystem functions were examined: food for large mobile predators, biogenic habitat provision, nutrient recycling/regeneration, inorganic carbon sequestration and food-web dynamics. In modern systems these ecological functions underpin ecosystem services that are important for human well-being. Our results show that the supply of food for higher predators was remarkably constant during the 4,000,000 years, suggesting that redundancy amongst species in the assemblage drives the biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) relationship. By contrast, the provision of biogenic habitat varied with the occurrence of a relatively few taxa, a pattern consistent with a rivet type model of BEF. For nutrient regeneration, carbon sequestration and food-web dynamics the patterns were complex and suggestive of an idiosyncratic model of BEF. To our knowledge this is the first study to quantify ecological functioning through deep time and demonstrates the utility of this approach to understanding long-term patterns of BEF in both ancient and contemporary marine ecosystems. The delivery of all five ecological functions studied became increasingly variable as the regional climate became drier, thus modifying the supply of terrigenous nutrient inputs. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem services; Food-web dynamics; Hypoxia; Kimmeridge clay formation; Nutrient regeneration; Palaeoecology","benthos; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; food web; hypoxia; Jurassic; nutrient; paleoecology; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959296743

Although ecosystem services related to surface water have been thoroughly described, the relationship between atmospheric water and ecosystem services has been mostly neglected, and perhaps misunderstood. Recent advances in land-atmosphere modeling have revealed the importance of terrestrial ecosystems for moisture recycling. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which vegetation sustains the supply of atmospheric moisture and precipitation for downwind beneficiaries, globally.We simulate land-surface evaporation with a global hydrology model and track changes to moisture recycling using an atmospheric moisture budget model, and we define vegetation-regulated moisture recycling as the difference in moisture recycling between current vegetation and a hypothetical desert world. Our results show that nearly a fifth of annual average precipitation falling on land is from vegetation-regulated moisture recycling, but the global variability is large, with many places receiving nearly half their precipitation from this ecosystem service. The largest potential impacts for changes to this ecosystem service are land-use changes across temperate regions in North America and Russia. Likewise, in semi-arid regions reliant on rainfed agricultural production, land-use change that even modestly reduces evaporation and subsequent precipitation, could significantly affect human well-being. We also present a regional case study in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil, where we identify the specific moisture recycling ecosystem services associated with the vegetation in Mato Grosso.We find that Mato Grosso vegetation regulates some internal precipitation, with a diffuse region of benefit downwind, primarily to the south and east, including the La Plata River basin and the megacities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. We synthesize our global and regional results into a generalized framework for describing moisture recycling as an ecosystem service. We conclude that future work ought to disentangle whether and how this vegetationregulated moisture recycling interacts with other ecosystem services, so that trade-offs can be assessed in a comprehensive and sustainable manner. © 2016 Keys et al.

This study used a novel methodology to (i) quantify the ecosystem services provided by dairy-based agro-ecosystems on two contrasting soils in New Zealand using a process-based model, (ii) determine the economic value of each service using on-farm built capital substitutes, and (iii) explore the merits of incorporating an ecosystems approach into land evaluation and resource management. Ecosystem services quantification proved insightful in distinguishing and quantifying the inherent differences in the capabilities of two contrasting soils to contribute to service provision by translating them into differences in performance under the same use, before calculating economic values. The economic value of the services provided by the system with Horotiu was on average 35% greater than the economic value of the services provided by the same land use on the Te Kowhai soil, with differences in the provision of some services (provision of food, flood mitigation, and the filtering of nutrients and contaminants) more pronounced between the two soils than others (provision of support, recycling of wastes). Regulating services had greater economic values than provisioning services for both agro-ecosystems.

Reserves are formally defined as a subset of resources, and even current and potential resources are only a small subset of ""all there is"". Peak production or exhaustion cannot be modeled accurately from reserves. Using copper as an example, identified resources are twice as large as the amount projected to be needed through 2050. Estimates of yet-to-be discovered copper resources are up to 40-times more than currently-identified resources, amounts that could last for many centuries. Thus, forecasts of imminent peak production due to resource exhaustion in the next 20-30 years are not valid. Short-term supply problems may arise, however, and supply-chain disruptions are possible at any time due to natural disasters (earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes) or political complications. Needed to resolve these problems are education and exploration technology development, access to prospective terrain, better recycling and better accounting of externalities associated with production (pollution, loss of ecosystem services and water and energy use). © 2016 by the authors.","Depletion; Ecosystem services; Life cycle assessment; Limits to growth; Material flow; Mineral resources; Peak copper; Production; Reserves; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018223522

Our aim is to address variations in nutrient resupply during decomposition - especially whether the N:P ratio of nutrient recycling via mineralization varies within and across diverse forest biomes. Location: Global forest ecosystems. Methods: We compiled data on in situ litter decomposition experiments (leaf, wood and root) from the primary literature to examine the relationships between net N and P mineralization across temperate versus tropical forests world-wide. We define net nutrient mineralization ratios as the average N:P released from decomposing substrates at a given ecosystem site. Results: We show that net N and P mineralization are strongly correlated within biomes, suggesting strong coupling between N and P recycling in forest ecosystems. The net N:P of leaf-litter mineralization is higher in tropical forests than in temperate forests, consistent with latitudinal patterns in foliar and leaf-litter N:P. At the global scale, the N:P of net mineralization tracks, but tends to be lower than that of litter N:P, pointing to preferential P (versus N) mineralization in forest ecosystems. Main conclusions: Our results do not support the view that there is a single, globally consistent mineralization N:P ratio. Instead, our results show that the N:P of net mineralization can be predicted by the N:P of litter, offering a method for incorporating P into global-scale models of carbon-nutrient-climate interactions. In addition, these results imply that P is scarce relative to microbial decomposer demands in tropical forests, whereas N and P may be more co-limiting when compared with microbial biomass in the temperate zone. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Decomposition; Mineralization; Nitrogen; Nutrient cycling; Phosphorus; Stoichiometry","carbon emission; decomposition; ecosystem service; forest ecosystem; litter; mineralization; net ecosystem production; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; stoichiometry; temperate forest; tropical forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959106052

The bivalve Mytilus edulis is an important contributor to this service, and is used in managing eutrophic waters. Studies show that they are affected by changes in pH due to ocean acidification, reducing their growth. This is forecasted to lead to reductions in M. edulis biomass of up to 50% by 2100. Growth reduction will negatively affect the filtering capacity of each individual, potentially leading to a decrease in bioremediation of waste. This paper critically reviews the current state of knowledge of bioremediation of waste carried out by M. edulis, and the current knowledge of the resultant effect of ocean acidification on this key service. We show that the effects of ocean acidification on waste bioremediation could be a major issue and pave the way for empirical studies of the topic. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioremediation; Ecosystem service; Experiments; Mytilus edulis; Ocean acidification; Waste","Acidification; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Experiments; Oceanography; Wastes; Ecosystem services; Empirical studies; Eutrophic water; Growth reduction; Key services; Mytilus edulis; Ocean acidifications; Waste bioremediation; Ecosystems; acidification; biomass; bioremediation; ecosystem service; eutrophication; growth response; marine pollution; mollusc; ocean; waste management; acidification; biomass; bioremediation; empiricism; filtration; Mytilus edulis; sea; animal; bioremediation; climate change; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Mytilus edulis; pH; physiology; sea; water pollutant; water quality; Bivalvia; Mytilus edulis; water pollutant; Animals; Biodegradation, Environmental; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mytilus edulis; Oceans and Seas; Water Pollutants; Water Quality",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959480563

The results showed that ecosystem service value of per unit area from maximum to minimum were in this order: wetland, water, garden, cultivated land, meadow, other land, salt pans, saline and alkaline land, constructive land. The order of contribution rates of each ecological function value from high to low was nutrient recycling, water conservation, entertainment and culture, material production, biodiversity maintenance, gas regulation, climate regulation and environmental purification.

The team assessed soil quality on 116 samples collected among four abandoned residential lots adjacent to the Comer Center. Soil quality data will be used in a follow-up study to determine the suitability of each lot for green infrastructure implementation. Green infrastructure may be a useful approach for providing ecosystem services and mitigating food deserts in inner-city communities. Soil quality on all lots was poor. All soils had pH &lt;8.0, low biological activity, and low N mineralization potential. The soils were rich in available P and had mean total Pb concentrations above the USEPA threshold (400 mg kg-1) for children's playlots. Mean bioavailable Pb on the largest of the four lots was 12% of total Pb, indicating that most of the total Pb is not bioavailable. This result is encouraging because high bioavailable Pb concentrations are linked with negative health effects, particularly in children. All lots had NO3 --N concentrations below those considered to be appropriate for plant growth. On the other hand, no significant differences in mean concentrations of the other analytes were found. The poor soil quality in the four lots presents an opportunity to use green infrastructure to enhance ecosystem services, improve community and environmental health, and provide more equitable access to green space. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.",,"Arid regions; Bioactivity; Ecosystems; Students; Ecosystem services; Environmental health; Equitable access; Follow-up Studies; Green infrastructure; Mean concentrations; Soil quality assessments; Undergraduate students; Soils; calcium salt; concrete; fresh water; heavy metal; phosphorus; soil organic matter; surface water; Article; crop; environmental health; eutrophication; fauna; mineralization; neighborhood; nutrient availability; plant growth; plant nutrient; prevalence; quality control; recycling; soil acidity; soil microflora; soil quality; United States; urban area; analysis; child; environmental health; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; follow up; human; soil; soil pollutant; Child; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957584341

Forests are integral to drinking water supplies for 30 % of the major cities in the world, and our existing managed and natural forests provide cleaner and more stable water supplies for surface water and groundwater than any other land use. One opportunity to minimize loss of forested landscapes, improve water quality, and regulate water availability is to consider coupling natural and managed forests with other environmental services such as wastewater treatment and management. These opportunities exist globally in wild lands, urban, suburban, and rural contexts at various scales across municipal, industrial, and agricultural systems. Wastewater treatment via land application has occurred since the 1500s in Europe and was established both in England and the United States in the late 1800s. Greater pressures exist today to manage water, wastewater, and forest systems in a sustainable manner. Advances in wastewater management provide new opportunities for forest-wastewater system design and use. The land application of wastewaters to forest ecosystems has historically focused on wastewater treatment and recycling. In the future, provisioning the world’s forests with adequate water may become as important as managing wastewaters with forested landscapes. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Ecosystem services; Forests; Land application; Wastewater",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017052314

Benefits associated with use of these materials on urban lands cover multiple categories. Resource conservation, greenhouse gas mitigation, improved soil tilth, higher net primary productivity, reduced infrastructure costs, and increased environmental literacy and awareness are some of the benefits (see soils section). This section will provide a basic background on waste treatment and describe types of organic residuals available in all urban areas. Composting is the most common means to stabilize organic wastes to make them suitable for use on urban soils. Composting can occur in a decentralized manner or as a municipal alternative to landfilling. A case study describes how food scraps were diverted from landfills to composting in Seattle. This is presented both from a political perspective and from the composter’s perspective. Small scale decentralized composting is also discussed.

However, soils’ degradation has increased in the last decades due anthropogenic activities leading to the loss of their functions and ecosystems services. Mining operations are one of the majors soil disruptors and are associated with a broad range of environmental negative impacts, including the decline of soils’ quality over large areas. The release of hazardous compounds, such as heavy metals and metalloids, during the extraction and processing of mineral ores leads to long-term contamination and hampers the survival of soil-associated microorganisms. The microbial diversity and activity in such polluted soils is disturbed causing negative cross-effects in the ecosystems, as soil microorganisms play a significant role in nutrient recycling and in biogeochemical cycles. Although microbial redundancy may occur and some microorganisms reveal resistance or tolerance mechanisms, the simplification of microbial communities and the subsequent decrease in their activity can lead to the failure of general soil functions.

Soil and landscape restoration are essential to strengthening ecosystem functions and services. The basic principles of landscape restoration include controlling soil erosion, reducing losses of water and nutrients, sequestering carbon, strengthening biogeochemical cycles, managing soil pH and salt balance, enhancing biocomplexity, and creating disease-suppressive soil. The technologies for landscape restoration must include implementation of soil restoration at the landscape level, harmonization of ecological effects with current and future population and social changes, and utilization of traditional knowledge. Establishing vegetation cover, managing water judiciously, recycling plant nutrients, and creating balanced plant nutrition are important to landscape restoration. Long-term planning is essential to the sustainable use of finite resources and provisioning of basic ecosystem services. Soil organic carbon concentration and quality are important to landscape restoration and ecosystem functions. Enhancing organic carbon concentration in the soil to above the threshold/critical level of 1.1%-2% in the root zone is needed to improve soil quality. This chapter considers the importance of the soil organic carbon pool to soil quality and outlines principles and strategies of soil and landscape restoration. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Indirect water reuse plays a role in meeting freshwater demands but there is limited documentation of it. There is a need to analyze its current status for water resources planning and conservation, and for understanding how it potentially impacts human health. However, the fact that data are archived in discrete uncoordinated databases by different state and federal entities, limits the capacity to complete holistic analysis of critical resources at large watershed scales. Humans alter the water cycle for food production, manufacturing, energy production, provision of potable water and recreation. Ecosystems services are affected at watershed scales but there are also global scale impacts from greenhouse gas emissions enabled by access to cooling, processing and irrigation water. To better document these issues and to demonstrate the utility of such an analysis, we studied the Wabash River Watershed located in the U.S. Midwest. Data for water extraction, use, discharge, and river flow were collected, curated and reorganized in order to characterize the water use and reuse within the basin. Indirect water reuse was estimated by comparing treated wastewater discharges with stream flows at selected points within the watershed. Results show that during the low flow months of July-October, wastewater discharges into the Wabash River basin contributed 82 to 121% of the stream flow, demonstrating that the level of water use and unplanned reuse is significant. These results suggest that intentional water reuse for consumptive purposes such as landscape or agricultural irrigation could have substantial ecological impacts by diminishing stream flow during vulnerable low flow periods. © 2015.","Indirect water reuse; Wabash river watershed; Wastewater discharges; Water data; Water withdrawals","Ecology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Potable water; Rivers; Stream flow; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water; Water conservation; Water supply; Water treatment; Watersheds; River watersheds; Wastewater discharge; Water datum; Water reuse; Water withdrawal; Water resources; ground water; surface water; waste water; basin management; discharge; environmental assessment; river flow; streamflow; wastewater; water use; watershed; Article; carbon footprint; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; priority journal; quantitative analysis; river basin; seasonal variation; stream (river); United States; waste water recycling; water analysis; water flow; water supply; watershed; environmental protection; procedures; sewage; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; waste water; water management; Midwest; United States; Wabash Basin; Conservation of Natural Resources; United States; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Purification; Water Resources; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941312805

The grey water footprint (GWF), defined as the volume of fresh water required to assimilate the load of pollutants discharged into water, is an indicator used to measure the degree of water pollution in a homogeneous unit. The GWF allows examination and contrast of the impacts of different pollutants located in different geographical areas, although it can also be used to compare the contamination impact with other types of impacts, such as the water extraction in aquifers. Although the potential and the foundations of the GWF formulation are well developed, the existing methodologies for calculating the GWF are still in an initial stage, which complicates matters when dealing with complex cases due to the newness of this indicator. This paper aims to develop a methodology that is appropriate for the comprehensive evaluation of the GWF at the river basin level. The methodology proposed considered the load of pollutants discharged in a basin, simulating the anthropised water cycle. This simulation, conducted by combining a hydrological model and a decision support system, enabled the calculation of GWF under present and future scenarios and/or the ex-ante analysis of the impact of different river basin management policies (e.g., wastewater treatment, water reuse, the joint use of surface and groundwater). Owing to all these advantages, the GWF is a highly useful indicator within the framework of integrated water resources management. The GWF assessment in the Segura River Basin (South-eastern Spain) highlighted both the validity and the general applicability of the methodology. The basin under study is affected by serious pollution issues and is one of the most complex exploitation systems in Europe. Additionally, fostering of the use of natural water resources, wastewater treatment actions, water reuse, desalinisation and external transfers are performed in this basin. The results indicate that the GWF of the Segura River Basin is greater than its renewable water resources, making it markedly unsustainable in both the short- and medium-term. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The knowledge about how carbon, N and P is distributed in wetland soils and whether there is a Redfiled-type C: N: P ratio in regional or global wetland soils is the basis for understanding fate of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and modeling matter circulation in wetland ecosystems. Objectives of this study are to examine whether there is a consistent C: N: P ratio in wetland soils of China and to find its potential influencing factors. [Method] Based on the data of carbon, nutrient contents, soil properties, vegetation, meteorology and C: N: P ratios of wetland soils of 119 marshes or wetlands published in the Journal of Marshes of China, ecological stoichiometric characteristics of C: N: P ratios on a regional scale and their potential affecting factors were analyzed with the mathematical statistics. [Result] Results show that the average C, N and P content in the wetlands of China was 22.93%, 0.76% and 0.16%, respectively; the average C: N, C: P and N: P ratio (mole ratio) was 18.22, 245.22 and 13.60, respectively, all higher than their respective ones in the soils of the country and the globe; and the average C: N: P ratio was 245:13.6:1. The C: N, C: P and N: P ratio in organic soils was higher than their respective ones in mineral soils. No significant difference was found in soil C: N: P between meadow, peat moss and forest wetlands; However, significant differences were found between inland freshwater, inland saline and tidal wetlands, with the inland freshwater wetlands being the highest and the tidal wetlands the lowest in C: P and N: P ratios, but. no difference in C: N was between the two. Overall, C: N, C: P and N: P ratios were the highest in inland freshwater wetlands and the lowest in tidal wetlands. Pearson analysis shows no significant pairwise relationship was found between the three elements, which implies that there is no Redfieldtype ratios in the wetland soils of China. Wetland ecosystems were more affected by P than the other soil nutrients. No significant difference in C: N ratio was found between climate zones, but a decreasing order of Tropical Zone > Temperate Zone > Plateau Temperate Zone > Warm Temperate Zone > Mid-subtropical Zone > Northern Subtropical Zone was, while C: P and N: P ratios differed significantly between climate zones, which followed an order of Plateau Temperate Zone > Temperate Zone > Mid-subtropical Zone > Tropical Zone > Warm Temperate Zone > Northern Subtropical Zone in C: P ratio and an order of Plateau Temperate Zone > Mid-subtropical Zone > Temperate Zone > Warm Temperate Zone > Tropical Zone > Northern Subtropical Zone in N: P ratio. Correlation analysis shows that altitude, temperatures (annual mean temperature, mean temperatures in January and July, and active accumulated temperature) and pH are the three main factors determining C: N: P ratios in the wetlands of China. [Conclusion] In conclusion, C: N: P in the wetland soils of China are highly affected by soil types and climate conditions, and little by plant vegetation. Taking into account the extremely significant correlations of altitude with C: P and N: P, altitude is deemed to be the decisive factor of C: N: P ecological stoichiometry of wetland soils.","C: N: P; Ecological stoichiometry; Soil; Wetland",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026510755

Wind power is considered one of the major renewable energy technologies to achieve low-carbon goals. With the other rapid development in China, wind farms have been constructed around the country, both onshore and offshore, to resolve energy resource and environmental challenges. The aim of this program is to develop wind power capacity to 200 million kilowatts in 2020 and to 1 billion kilowatts in 2050, to provide 17% of the electricity demand. In this study, the carbon emission of wind farms was analyzed using life cycle assessment, which is a powerful tool for energy system management and environmental emission mitigation. It has been widely used for environmental impact assessment of renewable energy systems. The life cycle of a wind turbine is assumed to be 21 years. The natural vegetation is incorporated into the system boundary, quantifying the impact of destruction and restoration of vegetation on carbon emissions before and after the construction stage. In the inventory analysis, the carbon emissions from production and transportation of accessories, as well as the fuel consumption of construction vehicles are considered, to provide a reasonable account of associated carbon emissions and to quantify the associated environmental impact. Then, carbon emissions from the three phases of the life cycle (construction, operation, and dismantling) were determined. The construction phase covers changes in vegetation, building, and transportation. The operation stage includes emissions from energy produced for the daily life activities of staff and for operating the main building and electrical equipment (e.g., wind farm lighting systems, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and primary and secondary communication equipment). Regarding the dismantling phase, waste material disposal may still produce carbon emissions. The calculation of carbon emissions is based on the amount of energy used and on various emission factors. Part of the carbon emissions derived from recycled materials was subtracted to avoid double accounting. The carbon emissions caused by laying fiber optic cables, diesel consumption of the mobile machinery shop, and consumption of electric energy were also considered. The results show that the carbon emissions of the whole life cycle of the concerned wind farm, from vegetation damage to scrap disposal, was 2.97×104tC, with the carbon emission intensity being 2.98×10-4tC kW-1h-1. This is close to the value for thermal power generation. The contribution by change in vegetation was almost zero, while those of building, transportation, and dismantling were 35.54%, 0.58%, 6.15%, respectively. The emission from consumption of electricity during operation was far larger than that for the other categories, making up 57.74% of total emissions. In contrast to the results from previous studies, we found that the carbon emissions from energy consumption are far larger than those from resource consumption. The methodology used in this paper may help provide a more comprehensive and detailed carbon emission inventory of wind farms. It could thus be considered a benchmark for further comparison of typical wind farm performance. In particular, the inclusion of the ecosystem services provided by the natural vegetation is the first step in calculating the potential support to be derived from the area surrounding the wind farm, which was often ignored in previous studies. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

Arecanut registered similar kernel yields in both sole and intercropped systems in all years. The sole Napier Bajra Hybrid (NBH) recorded significantly higher green fodder yield than intercropped NBH. There was 5-47% yield reduction in intercropped NBH in different plantations over sole NBH on unit area basis. The total standing carbon stocks were significantly higher in arecanut+fodder system (210-228tha-1) than arecanut sole and fodder sole. Total water use was 47 to 50% higher in arecanut sole (2340-3280m3) compared to ABMS (1178-1546m3) per unit area. The contribution of livestock to total outflows was high (82 to 87%) from 2008 to 2014 except in establishment year of dairy unit (54%). On an average, organic waste recycling potential of arecanut+dairy unit was 13.7tha-1 and dairy unit alone contributed to 87% of the manure production. Total nutrient supply from ABMS after recycling to the system was estimated at 218kgN, 51.8kg P and 33kgK that can meet N and P demand of 1.7 and 2.2ha of arecanut, respectively. The farm gate nutrient surplus was five times higher than utilization in ABMS that enables farmers to earn higher profits. The use of hard laterite soil for livestock enterprises like dairy, fishery and fodder cultivation resulted in improved resource use efficiency and profits per unit area per unit time. Dairy was economical under all scenarios due to on-farm fodder availability throughout the year.

To address negative externalities of these changes, two forms of ecological modernization of agriculture are promoted: “weak” ecological modernization, mainly based on increasing input efficiency through crop and animal monitoring and nutrient recycling, and “strong” ecological modernization, based on increasing agrobiodiversity at different space and time scales and within or among farms to develop ecosystem services and in turn reduce industrial inputs even more. Because characterizing the sustainability of these two forms of ecological modernization remains an issue, we review the literature on livestock systems to compare their advantages and drawbacks. After defining the livestock system as a local social–ecological system embedded in a complex multi-level and multi-domain system, we characterize the two forms of ecological modernization (weak vs. strong). When sustainability is defined as a state that should be maintained at a certain level and assessed through a set of indicators (environmental, economic, and social), we highlight that one ecological modernization form might have an advantage for certain sustainability criteria, but a disadvantage for others. When sustainability is viewed as a process (resilience), we find that these two forms of ecological modernization are based on different properties: governance of the entire agri-food chain for weak ecological modernization versus local governance of agriculture and its biophysical and social diversity and connectivity, and management of slow variables for strong ecological modernization. The relevance of this sustainability-analysis approach is illustrated by considering different types of dairy livestock systems, organic agriculture and integrated crop–livestock systems. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Agri-food chain; Agroecosystem; Dairy farm; Ecological principle; Innovation; Profitability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947038613

However, the achievement of these services in a particular agrosystem is not always required at the same time or to the same degree. Thus, species selection and definition of targeted objectives is critical when growing cover crops. The goal of the current work was to describe the traits that determine the suitability of five species (barley, rye, triticale, mustard and vetch) for cover cropping. A field trial was established during two seasons (October to April) in Madrid (central Spain). Ground cover and biomass were monitored at regular intervals during each growing season. A Gompertz model characterized ground cover until the decay observed after frosts, while biomass was fitted to Gompertz, logistic and linear-exponential equations. At the end of the experiment, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and fibre (neutral detergent, acid and lignin) contents, and the N fixed by the legume were determined. The grasses reached the highest ground cover (83-99%) and biomass (1226-1928 g/m2) at the end of the experiment. With the highest C:N ratio (27-39) and dietary fibre (527-600 mg/g) and the lowest residue quality (~680 mg/g), grasses were suitable for erosion control, catch crop and fodder. The vetch presented the lowest N uptake (2·4 and 0·7 g N/m2) due to N fixation (9·8 and 1·6 g N/m2) and low biomass accumulation. The mustard presented high N uptake in the warm year and could act as a catch crop, but low fodder capability in both years. The thermal time before reaching 30% ground cover was a good indicator of early coverage species. Variable quantification allowed finding variability among the species and provided information for further decisions involving cover crop selection and management.

Modern, resource-efficient farming systems based on integrated plant and animal production, effective nutrient recycling and low external inputs can enhance multiple agroecosystem services, resulting in reduced pollution. Practical examples of such farming systems are not widespread. Therefore, the Baltic Ecological Recycling Agriculture and Society (BERAS) Implementation project aimed to foster this systemic shift. In this paper, agronomic strategies are described to improve nitrogen (N) efficiency for the conversion to ecological recycling agriculture (ERA). First, N farm gate balances of 22 farms in conversion are presented. They showed a large variation from -9 to 90 kg·N·ha-1·a-1. Then, the use of guidelines and advisory tools to improve the nitrogen efficiency is described. The legume estimation trainer and nitrogen budget calculator help assess and optimize the nitrogen supply from legumes under farming conditions. The application of the crop rotation planning tool ""ROTOR"" guides advisors and farmers to identify agronomically and environmentally sound rotations. The tools can help overcome key agronomic constraints by implementing ERA. The necessity of accompanying measures from policy and the need to change food consumption patterns are discussed. © 2015 by the authors.","Assessment; Crop rotation; Eutrophication; Land use change and impact; Legumes; Nutrient efficiency; Resource-efficient cropping systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971454761

Nutrients such as phosphorus are hardly extracted and recycled from these wastes, except from sewage sludge. This paper discusses a concept for the recycling of P from a great variety of urban wastes (phyto-P-mining). Materials and methods: Phyto-P-mining is based on the plant extraction of P from waste materials, which were used to produce planting substrates. They are intended for the greening of urban structures, which were de-vegetated during urbanization or which were not intended to be vegetated before (secondary urban green). After the newly established plants have extracted P, their biomass can be used to produce bioenergy (biogas, wood) or compost. Phosphorus could then be recycled from digestion residues and ashes or directly from compost. Results and discussion: Phyto-P-mining is based on otherwise wasted nutrients and on the greening of a high number of not yet vegetated plots, including public or private plazas, sidewalks, roofs, and fallows. Greening is a major goal for urban planning, as functioning soil-vegetation-complexes provide ecosystem services such as climate regulation, dust absorption, wind brake, or aesthetic improvement. Especially in the dense inner city quarters, where vegetation is rare, new green improves public health and well-being. However, due to the lack of available horizontal but the high abundance of vertical structures like walls and facades in city centers, vertical green will be very important for phyto-P-mining. It can efficiently extract P from wastes due to its high ratio of biomass to ground area. Like the vertical areas, the vertical greens are often private properties. Although private greening is primarily conducted for social and cultural reasons, direct market benefits such as bioenergy or fertilizers may reduce costs for the greening. This will foster private urban greening to the benefit of the community and also the recycling of nutrients from urban resources. Conclusions: Phyto-P-mining based on secondary urban green will reestablish soil functions and natural cycling mechanisms in artificial urban systems. The approach has a great potential (i) to improve the urban living environments and to deliver benefits such as (ii) the recycling of phosphorus and other nutrients from urban wastes for the application in urban or rural agri- or horticulture and (iii) the ethically and ecologically sound production of bioenergy. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Constructed soils; Ecosystem services; Phosphorus recycling; Secondary urban green; Vertical green","bioenergy; biomass; compost; cost analysis; ecosystem service; fallow; greenspace; horticulture; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; plant extract; public health; recycling; sludge; substrate; urban planning; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937974271

In this paper, a bioenergy production system based on heathland biomass is investigated with the aim to explore how a system dynamics approach can help to analyze the impact of bioenergy production on ecosystem dynamics and services and vice versa. The effect of biomass harvesting on the heathland dynamics, ecosystem services such as biomass production and carbon capture, and its capacity to balance nitrogen inputs from atmospheric deposition and nitrogen recycling were analyzed. Harvesting was found to be beneficial for the maintenance of the heathland ecosystem if the biomass cut fraction is higher than 0.2 but lower than 0.6, but this will depend on the specific conditions of nitrogen deposition and nitrogen recycling. With 95% recycling of nitrogen, biomass production was increased by up to 25% for a cut fraction of 0.4, but at the expense of higher nitrogen accumulation and the system being less capable to withstand high atmospheric nitrogen deposition. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Biomass; Ecology; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen; Recycling; Atmospheric depositions; Atmospheric nitrogen deposition; Bioenergy productions; Biomass productions; Nitrogen accumulation; Nitrogen deposition; System dynamics approach; Technological process; Ecosystems; nitrogen; biofuel; carbon; nitrogen; soil; atmospheric deposition; bioenergy; biomass; carbon; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; heathland; nitrogen cycle; Article; atmospheric deposition; bioenergy; biomass; biomass production; ecosystem; heathland; nitrogen availability; nitrogen balance; nitrogen deposition; recycling; United Kingdom; atmosphere; biotechnology; chemistry; procedures; soil; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; Atmosphere; Biofuels; Biomass; Biotechnology; Carbon; Ecosystem; Great Britain; Nitrogen; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928910538

Stoichiometry allows for spanning different levels of biological organization, from cellular metabolism to ecosystem structure and nutrient cycling, and is therefore particularly useful for establishing links between different ecosystem compartments. We review elemental carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios in terrestrial ecosystems (from vegetation, leaf litter, woody debris, and dead roots, to soil microbes and organic matter). While the stoichiometry of the plant, litter, and soil compartments of ecosystems is well understood, heterotrophic microbial communities, which dominate the soil food web and drive nutrient cycling, have received increasing interest in recent years. This review highlights the effects of resource stoichiometry on soil microorganisms and decomposition, specifically on the structure and function of heterotrophic microbial communities and suggests several general patterns. First, latitudinal gradients of soil and litter stoichiometry are reflected in microbial community structure and function. Second, resource stoichiometry may cause changes in microbial interactions and community dynamics that lead to feedbacks in nutrient availability. Third, global change alters the C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios of primary producers, with repercussions for microbial decomposer communities and critical ecosystem services such as soil fertility. We argue that ecological stoichiometry provides a framework to analyze and predict such global change effects at various scales. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.","Carbon use efficiency; Growth rate hypothesis; Homeostasis; Litter decomposition; Nitrogen turnover; Nutrient recycling; Phosphorus deficiency; Soil enzymes; Soil microbiology; Substrate age hypothesis","carbon; community structure; decomposition; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; ecosystem structure; food web; nitrogen; nutrient availability; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; stoichiometry; terrestrial ecosystem; transformation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929069625

However, the assimilation of nutrients into APB provides a significant target for their recovery and reuse, and harvesting problematic APB in impacted freshwater bodies offers a complementary approach to aquatic restoration, which could potentially deliver multiple wider ecosystem benefits. This critical review provides an assessment of opportunities and risks linked to nutrient recovery from agriculturally impacted water-bodies through the harvesting of APB for recycling and reuse as fertilisers and soil amendments. By evaluating the economic, social, environmental and health-related dimensions of this resource recovery from 'waste' process we propose a research agenda for closing the loop on nutrient transfer from land to water. We identify that environmental benefits are rarely, if ever, prioritised as essential criteria for the exploitation of resources from waste and yet this is key for addressing the current imbalance that sees environmental managers routinely undervaluing the wider environmental benefits that may accrue beyond resource recovery. The approach we advocate for the recycling of 'waste' APB nutrients is to couple the remediation of eutrophic waters with the sustainable production of feed and fertiliser, whilst providing multiple downstream benefits and minimising environmental trade-offs. This integrated 'ecosystem services approach' has the potential to holistically close the loop on agricultural nutrient loss, and thus sustainably recover finite resources such as phosphorus from waste. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aquatic plants; Ecosystem services; Environmental human health; Legacy P; Nutrient cycling; Organic resource recovery","eutrophic water; fresh water; unclassified drug; water; fertilizer; water pollutant; agricultural land; agricultural runoff; aquatic plant; ecosystem service; eutrophic environment; eutrophication; habitat restoration; macrophyte; nutrient loss; phosphorus; phytomass; public health; restoration ecology; trade-off; agricultural land; agroecosystem; anaerobic digestion; animal food; biomass conversion; carbon sequestration; compost; eutrophication; harvesting; human; macronutrient; macrophyte; nonhuman; plant nutrient; processing; Review; soil amendment; waste water recycling; aquatic species; biomass; ecosystem; environmental protection; metabolism; plant; prevention and control; recycling; water pollutant; water pollution; Aquatic Organisms; Biomass; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Plants; Recycling; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922980952

Moreover, these systems offer a number of agro-ecosystem services such as forage production, soil carbon sequestration, nutrient recycling and soil protection. The scattered trees enhance the ecological complexity of grassland influencing the soil properties, the herbaceous layer diversity and composition and the soil communities. Understanding how isolated trees influence the other components of the system is essential to comprehend their role supporting high levels of above and below ground biodiversity and ecosystem services. In the present study, we present a hypothetical framework of the effects of isolated trees on soil properties, plant and soil fauna assemblages, the latter here represented by the class Collembola. The floor litter and the associated input of organic matter to the soil was a key factor linking the components of the tree-soil-biodiversity system in a Mediterranean cork oak wooded grassland.Topsoil C increased by +50% under the tree canopy in comparison with the areas beyond the tree canopy. Plant diversity was lower under tree canopy, but contributed to enhance the total species richness of the grassland. Collembolan diversity was higher under the peculiar conditions beneath the tree canopy. Relationships between plant and collembolan species emerged. The findings of this study suggest that isolated trees have direct and indirect effects on soil properties, plant and collembolan assemblages, hence they can influence the ecological processes of wooded grasslands, with implications for food webs, nutrient cycling and productivity of the agro-ecosystem. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Above-below ground biodiversity; Dehesa; Floor litter; Quercus suber; Soil fauna; Soil organic matter","agricultural ecosystem; arthropod; biodiversity; community composition; deciduous tree; ecosystem service; grassland; isolated population; litter; Mediterranean environment; soil fauna; soil organic matter; soil property; Animalia; Collembola; Quercus; Quercus suber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921502741

The energy consumption by waterbirds (96,605±18,311 individuals) on rice fields during winter averaged at 89.9±39.0kJ·m-2, with its majority (89.9%) belonging to foraging on rice seeds. Thus, the birds removed about 26% of rice seeds leftover after harvest (estimated in 932.5±504.7 seeds·m-2 in early winter) wherein common cranes and dabbling ducks (four species) were the most important consumers. Waterbirds foraging and roosting in the rice fields recycled more than 24.1 (1.0kg·ha-1) of N and an additional 5.0tons (0.2kg·ha-1) of P in the Extremadura's rice fields during winter. Additionally, we estimated that 2.3tons of N and 550kg of P were removed from rice fields and transported to reservoirs. The seasonal foraging of wildlife should result in a direct benefit for rice farmers by improving nutrient recycling through defecation by waterbirds with respect to artificial fertilisation. Additionally, rice fields located in the cranes' core wintering areas can provide sufficient food supply to induce habitat shift from their traditional wintering habitat in 'dehesas' to rice fields, which causes indirect socioeconomic benefit through reduced acorn consumption by cranes. Our modelling approach may thus be especially helpful for management decisions regarding rice agroecosystems in areas which are also important for the conservation of migratory waterbirds. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Cranes; Dabbling ducks; Ecosystem services; Extremadura; Isotopes; Management; Nitrogen; Phosphorous","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Birds; Conservation; Cranes; Energy utilization; Food supply; Isotopes; Management; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Recycling; Biodiversity conservation; Biogeochemical cycle; Dabbling ducks; Ecosystem services; Extremadura; Phosphorous; Socio-economic benefits; Stable-isotope analysis; Ecosystems; nitrogen; phosphorus; agricultural ecosystem; biodiversity; conservation management; ecosystem service; food consumption; migratory species; nutrient cycling; paddy field; trophic structure; waterfowl; agricultural land; agroecosystem; Anas (genus); Article; conservation biology; crane (bird); defecation; energy consumption; fertilizer application; food intake; foraging behavior; habitat selection; harvesting; migrant bird; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; nutrient loading; nutrient recycling; overwintering; place preference; plant seed; population abundance; reservoir; rice; rice field; rice seed; Southern Europe; trophic level; water bird; winter; agriculture; animal; biodiversity; bird; ecosystem; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental protection; physiology; procedures; wetland; Extremadura; Spain; Anas; Aves; Gruidae; Grus grus; Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecological and Environmental Processes; Ecosystem; Oryza sativa; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920079490

This is particularly true in the south central USA, where rapidly growing urban areas are running out of water and human-engineered water storage and management are leading to broad-scale changes in flow regimes. The Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma, USA, has high fish and freshwater mussel biodiversity. However, water from this rural river is desired by multiple urban areas and other entities. Freshwater mussels are large, long-lived filter feeders that provide important ecosystem services. We ask how observed changes in mussel biomass and community composition resulting from drought-induced changes in flow regimes might lead to changes in river ecosystem services. We sampled mussel communities in this river over a 20-year period that included two severe droughts. We then used laboratory-derived physiological rates and river-wide estimates of species-specific mussel biomass to estimate three aggregate ecosystem services provided by mussels over this time period: biofiltration, nutrient recycling (nitrogen and phosphorus), and nutrient storage (nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon). Mussel populations declined over 60%, and declines were directly linked to drought-induced changes in flow regimes. All ecosystem services declined over time and mirrored biomass losses. Mussel declines were exacerbated by human water management, which has increased the magnitude and frequency of hydrologic drought in downstream reaches of the river. Freshwater mussels are globally imperiled and declining around the world. Summed across multiple streams and rivers, mussel losses similar to those we document here could have considerable consequences for downstream water quality although lost biofiltration and nutrient retention. While we cannot control the frequency and severity of climatological droughts, water releases from reservoirs could be used to augment stream flows and prevent compounded anthropogenic stressors. Hydrological drought is becoming more frequent and intense in many areas of the world. At the same time many aquatic species are declining. Our study documents how the drought-induced decline of one important freshwater group, long-lived, filter-feeding freshwater mussels, has led to large decreases in regulating ecosystem services. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Biofiltration; Drought; Ecosystem service; Environmental flows; Flow regime; Freshwater mussel; Nutrient cycling; Nutrient storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924961730

The consequences of these basic differences are discussed in terms of the ecosystem services that are provided by the two different AG types, and parks. In terms of ecology, there is higher species richness on AGs with a greater proportion of neophytes, which may potentially spread into cities.

However, a better understanding of such potential ecosystem services is needed. We summarized the current state of knowledge of CC effects on soil C stocks, soil erosion, physical properties, soil water, nutrients, microbial properties, weed control, crop yields, expanded uses, and economics and highlighted research needs. Our review indicates that CCs are multifunctional. Cover crops increase soil organic C stocks (0.1-1. Mg ha-1 yr-1) with the magnitude depending on biomass amount, years in CCs, and initial soil C level. Runoff loss can decrease by up to 80% and sediment loss from 40 to 96% with CCs. Wind erosion potential also decreases with CCs, but studies are few. Cover crops alleviate soil compaction, improve soil structural and hydraulic properties, moderate soil temperature, improve microbial properties, recycle nutrients, and suppress weeds. Cover crops increase or have no effect on crop yields but reduce yields in water-limited regions by reducing available water for the subsequent crops. The few available studies indicate that grazing and haying of CCs do not adversely affect soil and crop production, which suggests that CC biomass removal for livestock or biofuel production can be another benefit from CCs. Overall, CCs provide numerous ecosystem services (i.e., soil, crop-livestock systems, and environment), although the magnitude of benefits is highly site specific. More research data are needed on the (i) multi-functionality of CCs for different climates and management scenarios and (ii) short-and long-term economic return from CCs. © 2015 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945358723

In other words, the paradigm recognises, and tries to reconcile, the many competing uses of freshwater: water for human/domestic use, agriculture and industrial and energy production, and natural ecosystems. Although the water needs of natural ecosystems are amply recognised in Integrated Water Resources Management theory (Global Water Partnership 2000), in practice they are sacrificed in favour of productive water uses - especially in developing countries. Every year more and more water is withdrawn from the hydrological cycle for productive purposes. As a result, the resource is increasingly commoditised and disputed. The competition for water is also more global than ever, which has led to frequent instances of land and water grabbing (Woodhouse 2012). In this context of international competition, the sidelining of natural ecosystems in water resources management is likely to be exacerbated. This will amplify the water crisis even further, given the central role of natural ecosystems in the provision, regulation, and recycling of water resources; according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, forest and mountain ecosystems are the sources of 85% of the world’s total freshwater runoff (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005, p.167). We argue that ecosystem services-based approaches can encourage Integrated Water Resources Management practice to pay adequate attention to the water needs of natural ecosystems, i.e. their water requirements for provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services as well as the maintenance of the overall ecosystem health. Because natural ecosystems themselves are the major users of the world’s freshwater resources, effective implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management is needed to sustain and enhance the services derived from these ecosystems. © UNESCO 2015.

Insects are one of the most diverse groups, playing a significant role in maintaining ecosystem function and ecological balance, and fulfilling human demands. Insect ecological services are the functional roles in ecosystem processes, benefiting humans with goods and services such as pollination, pest control and decomposition. Insect ecological services include provisioning, regulation, cultural and support services. The economic value of insect ecological services can be divided into direct-, indirect-, option- and existence values. The ecological regulating services of insects involve pollination, biological control and dung burial. Insects perform pollination services to crops, vegetables and fruits which are an important ecological service. Pollination is usually the transfer of pollen from the male sex organ to the receptive portion of the female sex organ in flowering plants. Insect pollinators are adapted to many flowering plant species and are provided with primary rewards that attract (i.e., “attract and reward”) and establish pollen vectors returning to flowers. Rewards include nectar, pollen, lipid secretions, food bodies, scents, resins, and material for nest building. Biological control is a particular type of pest control, resulting in predatory/parasitoid insects suppressing pest densities to relatively low levels. This type of ecologically based pest management infers that the “natural enemies” control the pest species. The types of natural enemies used for biological control vary depending on the type of pest. The decomposition of organic matter and the recycling of carbon are provided by beetles that bury dung. Dung beetles process a substantial amount of the animal dung that has accumulated in ecosystem. Dung beetles are medium to large-sized beetles specializing in feeding and breeding on an ephemeral and discrete food resource, consisting mainly of the dung piles produced by herbivorous warm-blooded animals. The dung beetles provide regulating services that reduce forage fouling, nitrogen volatilization, parasites and pest flies. Humans could not persist without these insect provided services. Estimating the value of ecological services provided by insects may help establish a higher priority for their conservation. This paper discusses the concept and categorization of insect ecosystem services, including an economic evaluation of those services. In 2007, insect pollination, pest control and dung burial values were estimated using agricultural production data from China. The results indicated that the insect regulating service value for pollination was 6790.30×108 yuan RMB, accounting for up to 54.05% of the total value of pollinator serviced crops. The value of pest control from natural enemies was 2621.00×108 yuan RMB, which was up to 9.09% of the total value of the crops serviced. The value of dung burial was 90.84×108 yuan RMB. The total insect regulating service was valued at 9502.14×108 yuan RMB, accounting for up to 3.7% of China's GDP (2007). These results show the annual value of insect regulating service in an agroecosystem are similar to the economic values of grassland or forest ecosystem services in China. The accurate valuation of insect ecological services is critical to establishing and preserving the ongoing development of insect-based resources and biodiversity in China. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

It is applied to the Stockholm-Mï¿½lar region in southeast Sweden where the EU 2050 climate policy for carbon emissions and the Baltic Sea action plan for nutrient discharges are applied. The results show that the value of carbon and nutrient sequestration can correspond to approximately 0.5% of the region's gross domestic product, or 40% of the value of productive forest. The largest part of this value is attributed to carbon sequestration because of the relative stringency in targets and expensive alternative abatement measures. However, sequestration is uncertain because of stochastic weather conditions, and when society has a large risk aversion for not attaining climate and nutrient targets, the values of the forest carbon and nutrient sequestration can approach zero. ï¿½ 2015 by the authors.","Forest carbon and nutrient sequestration; Replacement cost method; Stockholm-Mï¿½lar region; Uncertainty; Values","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Ecosystems; Nutrients; Optimization; Recycling; Stochastic systems; Nutrient sequestration; Replacement cost methods; Stockholm; Uncertainty; Values; Forestry; abatement cost; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; environmental policy; European Union; forest ecosystem; nutrient cycling; uncertainty analysis; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946403519

The processes of denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) remove N from estuaries by producing N2 gas, and each can be coupled to N recycling pathways such as nitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Environmental conditions such as seawater intrusion influence sedimentary estuarine N cycling processes. This study investigated the potential effects of seawater intrusion on N cycling processes and their couplings through a comparative modeling approach. We applied environ analysis, a form of ecosystem network analysis, to 2 N cycling mass-balance network models constructed at oligohaline and polyhaline sites in the Cape Fear River Estuary, North Carolina, USA. We found that nitrification coupled to both denitrification and anammox was 2.5 times greater at the oligohaline site, while DNRA coupled to anammox was 2.7 times greater at the polyhaline site. However, the total amount of N2 gas produced relative to the N inputs to each network was 4.7 and 4.6% at the oligohaline and polyhaline sites, respectively, as direct removal was greater at the polyhaline site.

This work assessed the influence of reusing or discharge of treated water and sludge landfill or compost on the sustainability of an integrated sewage treatment system using emergy analysis and newly proposed emergy indicators. This system's value included its environmental benefits and the products. Environmental benefits were the differences of the environmental service values before and after sewage treatment. Due to unavailability of data of the exchanged substance and energy in the internal system, products' values were attained by newly proposed substitution values. The results showed that the combination of sewage treatment, treated water reuse and sludge landfill had the strongest competitiveness, while the combination of sewage treatment, treated water reuse and earthworm compost was the most sustainable. Moreover, treated water reuse and earthworm compost were helpful for improving the sustainability of the integrated sewage treatment system. The quality of treated water and local conditions should be also considered when implementing the treated water reuse or discharge. The resources efficiency of earthworm compost unit needed to be further improved. Improved emergy indices were more suitable for integrated sewage treatment systems. ©, 2015, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology.

The present study aims to assess the effect of organic waste recycling (empty fruit bunches, EFB) on soil biodiversity in a mature plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia. A chronosequence was delineated taking into account the time between the applications of EFB and soil sampling; intervals of 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months were compared with control plots without EFB application. Soil physical and chemical characteristics and macrofauna and nematofauna populations were analysed. The findings highlighted three distinct periods: a first disturbance period (0-6 months) showing a marked increase in pH, potassium content, base saturation and macrofauna abundance, especially ants, whereas earthworm, millipede and nematode populations were substantially reduced; a resilience period (6-18 months); and a final period (18-24 months) showing an improvement in most soil fertility parameters and a high density of earthworms, millipedes and nematodes. The impact of EFB application on soil quality changed as a function of time, and the present results explain the apparent discrepancy of some previous published results.

Optimal groundwater extraction can be incentivized by pricing according to the Pearce equation for renewable resources, although the standard version of the equation must be modified in certain situations, e.g., to accommodate corner solutions or governance costs. Groundwater management and pricing must be coordinated with the management of watershed and related resources lest the benefits of conservation are squandered by wasting the water saved. Joint optimization also provides the basis for correctly pricing ecosystem services such as groundwater recharge. From the models and examples discussed, one can conclude that a systems approach is necessary, and ad hoc rules of thumb such as maximum sustainable yield are welfare reducing. Whether or not these types of welfare reductions are substantial depends largely on the particular management problem. The Gisser-Sánchez (GS) effect suggests that the welfare effects of first-best management are relatively small when the aquifer is large enough relative to the quantity demanded at extraction cost, but the welfare gains can become quite substantial as those assumptions are relaxed. Inasmuch as actual groundwater management may be far from efficient in many regions, the GS effect notwithstanding the problem of optimal resource governance is discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Environmental degradation, overexploitation of water resources and agricultural intensification make the province’s ecosystems particularly vulnerable to harm during droughts and other weather hazards, in turn increasing the vulnerability of the populations that depend upon the land and its ecosystem services to support their livelihoods. Ningxia is one of the most arid regions of China, experiencing serious water resource shortages due to lack of supply availability, inefficient use of water supplies and high demand, with high evapotranspiration rates (Xu et al., 2013). The province’s average annual per capita water availability is 687 m3, less than one-third of the national average at an amount categorised as ‘severe water shortage’ according to World Bank standards (Qiu et al., 2012; see also Chapter 4). Fragile soils, land use changes and multi-year droughts have intensified desertification rates, with degraded areas now accounting for around 44% of provincial land area (Qiu et al., 2012). The types of challenges that Ningxia faces exemplify some aspects of China’s larger adaptation challenge. Families in Ningxia that rely on agriculture and livestock raising for their living, like Ma Changjun’s, cannot afford to waste a drop of water. His family and those living in Yanchi in Ningxia make their living by growing maize and breeding sheep, and through temporary migration to find work in other places. Many families in rural communities in central and northern parts of the province (Figure 8.1) rely on cisterns to meet drinking water needs, and they ration and recycle water from bathing to wash clothes and water their vegetables and sheep. Despite this, there is not enough water in some years, Ma says in a 2012 interview. Drought, declines in rainfall over the past two decades and overgrazing that damages the land are stressing these families’ abilities to survive. The types of issues facing Ningxia’s families – land use and water resource management, transitioning socio-economic conditions, pollution issues and migration – are emblematic of the types of issues facing families in other provinces in China, particularly rural families. Many rural provinces, including Ningxia, have greater proportions of ethnic groups who have different cultures, traditional livelihoods and relationships with the land – in effect marking multiple Chinas. These identities and socio-cultural values are shifting in response to wider environmental, policy and economic pressures, as discussed in Chapter 2. Climate change is an additional pressure placed upon the inhabitants of Ningxia, and altering their climate risks. © 2016 Rebecca Nadin, Sarah Opitz-Stapleton and Xu Yinlong.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086201381

In contrast to customary vegetable production, pollution-free production uses organic fertilizers and biological pesticides instead of chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides. This mode of production improves the safety of the vegetables and reduces environmental pollution, and the government is encouraging its use throughout China. Nevertheless, there is still considerable scope for research into efficient and sustainable vegetable production. Emergy evaluation is an effective tool in analyzing the efficiency and sustainability of an ecological system, which addresses the weakness of traditional energy analysis and expresses different forms of energy using a common physical basis, namely, solar emergy. It also has the advantage of taking into consideration aspects such as natural resources, labor, and ecosystem services that are generally left uncalculated by other evaluation methods. This paper evaluated the efficiency and sustainability of a pollution-free vegetable production system based on emergy analysis, and results were compared with those of a customary vegetable production system. At the same time, the renewability factor of each input item was introduced in this study to improve analysis of the types of energy input. The emergy input structure and energy-based indices such as emergy efficiency (UEV), renewability (ΦR), net emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental loading rate (ELR), product safety index based-emergy (PSI), emergy sustainability index (ESI), and emergy-based monetary value (EmRMB) were analyzed to estimate the efficiency and sustainability of the pollution-free vegetable system, and to determine the key points affecting the ecological performance of the system. The results showed that the total energy input of the two modes of the pollution-free vegetables production system were 4.97×1016 sej/year and 4.12×1016 sej/year, respectively. Compared with the customary vegetable production system, the UEV, EYR, ΦR, EPSI, and ESI values of the pollution-free vegetable production system rose on average by 24.3%, 24.9%, 36.0%, 98.2%, and 387.0%, respectively; and on average the ELR value declined by 64.7% and the EmRMB by 20.0%. At the same time, we found that that labor input and irrigation were the core factors that affected the efficiency and sustainability of the system. The scenario analysis revealed that the emergy efficiency and sustainability of the current pollution-free vegetable production system could be improved by 3.4%-10.8% and by 1.2%-31.7%, respectively, by creating an efficient system capable of adjusting to changes such as collection of rainfall to irrigate vegetables in a greenhouse, usage of electricity from a biogas project to irrigate, and reducing the labor input by applying standardized management. From an economic point of view, the reduction in purchased inputs and the higher price of pollution-free vegetables can be beneficial to the farmer. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the introduction of pollution-free vegetable production into recycling agriculture and the usage of biogas slurry as the main fertilizer have positive economic and ecological effects. Consequently, there is a considerable prospect for the development of pollution-free vegetables in China. The results also indicated that emergy evaluation is an effective method to analyze the vegetable ecological system and could provide a useful tool in the development of pollution-free vegetable production in China. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

Indeed agricultural areas have a great potential in terms of urban re-generation, fostering a city’s resilience and its energy efficiency, even in the perspective of climate change hazards. Further agricultural areas are also crucial for social opportunities and new job creation in the perspective of integrating both ecological and urban services in the framework of more competitive (and attractive) cities. According to the MEA definition of ecosystem services as constituents of well-being (MAE, 2005), this paper presents a case study that addresses the following questions: Can we consider the urban agricultural areas as an ecological infrastructure for the city? And, if affirmative, can we manage it in a more integrated way? The study is structured as a research case study and focuses on a former agricultural area in the city centre of Naples, Italy. This is an almost three hectares area on the hill of San Martino featured by being an important city’s landmark. Despite the abandonment of crops, the agricultural land use is still typical of the hill and it represents a core potential to provide ecological and urban services for the city. The study discusses a demonstration project aimed at assessing comprehensive viability for managing agricultural use in order to protect the natural soils and updating both urban and ecological services (such as waste management, social security, sliding risk reduction) through a non-conventional public service policy. © 2014 WIT Press.","Recycling urban soil; Socio-ecological system; Urban farming","agricultural land; ecosystem service; financial crisis; recycling; urban agriculture; urban economy; Campania [Italy]; Italy; Naples; Napoli [Campania]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942109704

The system is the last urban river in the vicinity of Mexico City that supplies surface water to the urban area. Historical flow data were analyzed (1973-2010), along with the physicochemical and bacteriological attributes, documenting the evolution of these variables over the course of five years (2008-2012) in both dry and rainy seasons. The analyses show that the flow regime has been significantly altered. The physicochemical variables show significant differences between the natural area, where the river originates, and the urban area, where the river receives untreated wastewater. Nutrient and conductivity concentrations in the river were equivalent to domestic wastewater. Fecal pollution indicators and various pathogens were present in elevated densities, demonstrating a threat to the population living near the river. Estimates of the value of the water lost as a result of mixing clean and contaminated water are presented. This urban river should be rehabilitated as a sustainability practice, and if possible, these efforts should be replicated in other areas. Because of the public health issues and in view of the population exposure where the river flows through the city, the river should be improved aesthetically and should be treated to allow its ecosystem services to recover. This river represents an iconic case for Mexico City because it connects the natural and urban areas in a socioecological system that can potentially provide clean water for human consumption. Contaminated water could be treated and reused for irrigation in one of the green areas of the city. Wastewater treatment plants and the operation of the existing purification plants are urgent priorities that could lead to better, more sustainable water use practices in Mexico City. © 2014 Mazari-Hiriart et al.",,"article; bacterial count; bacterium identification; coliphage; concentration (parameters); conductance; ecosystem; Enterococcus; fecal coliform; feces; Mexico; microbiological examination; nonhuman; nutrient; physical chemistry; protozoon; river; season; urban area; virus identification; waste water; waste water recycling; water contamination; water flow; water pollution; water quality; water treatment; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; geography; human; microbiology; procedures; river; water pollutant; water supply; rain; waste water; water pollutant; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Humans; Mexico; Rain; Rivers; Waste Water; Water Microbiology; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904630473

The magnitude of soil organic, inorganic and total carbon stocks in the semi-arid bioclimate is estimated at 2.9, 1.9 and 4.8. Pg respectively. Sorghum, finger millet, pearl millet, maize, rice, groundnut, soybean, cotton, food legumes etc. are predominant crop production systems with a little, if any, recycling of organic matter. Data from the long term experiments on major rainfed production systems in India show that higher amount of crop residue C input (Mg/ha/y) return back to soil in soybean-safflower (3.37) system practiced in Vertisol region of central India. Long term addition of chemical fertilizer and organic amendments improved the SOC stock. For every Mg/ha increase in SOC stock in the root zone, there occurs an increase in grain yield (kg/ha) of 13, 101, 90, 170, 145, 18 and 160 for groundnut, finger millet, sorghum, pearl millet, soybean and rice, respectively. Long-term cropping without using any organic amendment and/or mineral fertilizers can severely deplete the SOC stock which is the highest in groundnut-finger millet system (0.92. Mg. C/ha/y) in Alfisols. Some agroforestry systems also have a huge potential of C sequestration to the extent of 10. Mg/ha/y in short rotation eucalyptus and Leucaena plantations. The critical level of C input requirements for maintaining SOC at the antecedent level ranges from 1.1 to 3.5. Mg. C/ha/y and differs among soil type and production systems. National level policy interventions needed to promote sustainable use of soil and water resources include prohibiting residue burning, reducing deforestation, promoting integrated farming systems and facilitating payments for ecosystem services. A wide spread adoption of these measures can improve soil quality through increase in SOC sequestration and improvement in agronomic productivity of rainfed agroecosystems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon fractions; Carbon sequestration; Conservation agriculture; Crop residue; Integrated nutrient management; Rainfed agroecosystem","Agricultural wastes; Carbon; Cultivation; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Production engineering; Productivity; Water resources; Agro ecosystems; Carbon fraction; Carbon sequestration; Conservation agricultures; Crop residue; Integrated nutrients; Soils; organic matter; agricultural ecosystem; agroforestry; agronomy; carbon sequestration; crop production; crop residue; deforestation; ecosystem service; farming system; fertilizer application; inorganic carbon; organic carbon; organic matter; rainfed agriculture; rhizosphere; semiarid region; soil amendment; soil carbon; soil quality; sustainability; Vertisol; agroecosystem; agroforestry; article; carbon sequestration; controlled study; cotton; crop production; cropping system; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; Eucalyptus; finger millet; geographic distribution; grain yield; India; land use; legume; Leucaena; maize; nonhuman; peanut; pearl millet; plantation; priority journal; rice; semiarid climate; soil degradation; soil management; soil quality; sorghum; soybean; India; Carthamus tinctorius; Eleusine coracana; Eucalyptus; Glycine max; Gossypium hirsutum; Leucaena; Pennisetum glaucum; Zea mays; Carbon fractions; Carbon sequestration; Conservation agriculture; Crop residue; Integrated nutrient management; Rainfed agroecosystem; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; India; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900849612

These challenges have led to a societal expectation that the agricultural sector increase productivity, and at the same time provide environmental 'ecosystem services' such as the provision of clean water, air, habitats for biodiversity, recycling of nutrients and mitigation against climate change. Whilst the degree to which agriculture can provide individual ecosystem services has been well researched, it is unclear how and to what extent agriculture can meet all expectations relating to environmental sustainability simultaneously, whilst increasing the quantity of food outputs. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for the quantification of the 'supply of' and 'demand for' agricultural, soil-based ecosystem services or 'soil functions'. We use Irish agriculture as a case-study for this framework, using proxy-indicators to determine the demand for individual soil functions, as set by agri-environmental policies, as well as the supply of soil functions, as defined by land use and soil type. We subsequently discuss how this functionality of soils can be managed or incentivised through policy measures, with a view to minimising the divergence between agronomic policies designed to promote increased agricultural production and environmental policy objectives. Finally, we discuss the applicability of this conceptual framework to agriculture and agri-environmental policies at EU level, and the implications for policy makers. © 2013 The Authors.","Food security; Soil framework directive; Soil functions; Soil quality; Thematic strategy on soils",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894249874

Nitrogen retention was calculated in two agricultural catchments by the dynamic Integrated Nutrients in Catchments (INCA)-N model. The monetary valuation was based on purification efficiency of artificial wetlands. The set of scenarios were based on existing agricultural water protection measures, and greening of the Common Agricultural Policy proposal. Scenarios were: wintertime crop cover on fields, increase in area of set aside land, decrease in nitrogen fertilization, crop diversification and nutrient recycling in organic farming. Nitrogen retention provided more value in the Yläneenjoki catchment where the main production line was animal husbandry. In the slowly flowing river Lepsämänjoki, the N retention was more effective than in the fast flowing river Yläneenjoki. When comparing measures some proved to have no value or even a negative value. Set aside had a high positive value when calculated per area, but on a catchment scale the value remained low because of the small area of implementation. Nutrient recycling and winter time vegetation cover were the scenarios that reduced N leaching from fields close to targets set in current political decisions. None of the scenarios increased greenhouse gas emissions. © IWA Publishing 2014.","Agricultural scenarios; Catchment scale modeling; Common Agricultural Policy (CAP); Ecosystem services; Nitrogen retention","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Recycling; Runoff; Agricultural scenarios; Catchment scale; Common agricultural policy; Ecosystem services; Nitrogen retention; Catchments; animal husbandry; catchment; Common Agricultural Policy; ecosystem service; greenhouse gas; land management; leaching; nitrogen; nutrient; organic farming; set-aside; valuation; vegetation cover; winter; Finland; Varsinais-Suomi; Ylaneenjoki River",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906212683

Ecosystem services (ESS) can be nutrient recycling, pollination, pest control, etc. and they are linked to BD which is the focus of management. A typical problem in nature valuation is that, although there might exist an eventual vehicle for payment (land use), the underlying ecology might be very complex. To solve this problem we suggest an approach in which ecosystem management is conducted by ecologists who possess the knowledge of pertinent functional relationships between species prevalence and ESS provision. Farmers are compensated based on priority setting and suitability of land as a specific acquisition. Valuation (of species) is presented as a simulation (of a market-like process), i.e. balancing value revelations, based on shadow prices of providers (farmers), users (citizens) and ecologists. We address conflicts with ecologists as managers, farmers as profit maximizers, and citizens as utility retrievers. It is primarily a conflict between managers who argue ecologically for preferred species and land users who have limited knowledge: the conflict is solved by balancing interests. Our approach calibrates interest functions and it allows for quasi-market coordination and public management. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cultural landscape; Nature provision by farmers; PES-valuation; Species composition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905160667

At the same time, the vastness of the high seas and the limitations of corresponding governance instruments present a considerable challenge to policy-makers working to promote sustainable management. This report reviews new developments in sustainable management of the oceans, including the high seas, which has often focused primarily on fishing regulations, while lacking broader consideration of marine ecosystem services and material cycles. In addition, an overview is provided of paradigms for assessing and managing marine systems. Enhanced interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral communication based on clear definitions is needed to achieve deeper understanding of marine ecosystems and the services they provide. Experts discussed these and other issues on October 1, 2013 within the context of an international symposium held at the University of Tokyo on the ""Future Management of Ocean Ecosystem Services"".

With worsening hypoxia, the role of sediments changes from nitrogen removal to nitrogen release as ammonium. At present, denitrification in the water column and sediments is equally important. Phosphorus is currently buried in sediments mainly in organic form, with an additional contribution of reduced Fe-phosphate minerals in the deep anoxic basins. Upon the transition to oxic conditions, a significant proportion of the organic phosphorus will be remineralized, with the phosphorus then being bound to iron oxides. This iron-oxide bound phosphorus is readily released to the water column upon the onset of hypoxia again. Important ecosystems services carried out by the benthic fauna, including biogeochemical feedback-loops and biomass production, are also lost with hypoxia. The results provide quantitative knowledge of nutrient release and recycling processes under various environmental conditions in support of decision support tools underlying the Baltic Sea Action Plan. © The Author(s) 2013.","Climate change; Ecosystem recovery; Ecosystem services; Eutrophication; Nutrient management; Regime shift","nitrogen; oxygen; phosphorus; sea water; article; Baltic States; biomass; ecosystem; eutrophication; sea; sediment; Baltic States; Biomass; Ecosystem; Eutrophication; Geologic Sediments; Nitrogen; Oceans and Seas; Oxygen; Phosphorus; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898404596

This development is explained by market and sector economic logic and has been reinforced by the availability of low-cost inputs and animal housing systems based on direct grazing not requiring straw. It has, however, also involved negative environmental impacts and, in some cases, the impoverishment of soil fertility, a loss of biodiversity, and excesses of N and P, leading to eutrophication and hot spots of ammonia emission in livestock-breeding territories. Having recapped the mechanisms behind the specialization of systems and territories, we examined the extent to which the development of innovative mixed-farming systems that reconnect livestock and crop production on various territorial scales (farm, district, region) can reduce the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, produce valuable ecosystem services and achieve acceptable economic efficiency for farming enterprises. Examples from temperate regions will be used to show that mixed-farming systems increase the possibilities of better recycling of nutrients within systems, limiting recourse to the purchase of increasingly expensive inputs and safeguarding the biodiversity of agricultural ecosystems. © 2014 .","Environment; Geographical scale; Grassland; Legume; Mixed-farming system; Nutrient cycle","cost-benefit analysis; crop production; ecosystem service; environmental impact; geographical region; integrated approach; literature review; market system; mixed farming; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; soil fertility; specialization; territory; South America; Western Europe; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901266903

As a result, our knowledge about anthropogenic-induced changes in biodiversity and associated soil functions is limited. We quantified an array of soil biological constituents (plants, earthworms, nematodes, bacteria, and fungi) to explore their interactions and to characterize their influence on various soil functions (habitat for soil organisms, air and water regulation, and recycling of nutrients and organic waste) along a legacy Cu pollution gradient. Increasing Cu concentrations had a detrimental impact on both plant growth and species richness. Belowground soil biota showed similar responses, with their sensitivity to elevated Cu concentrations decreasing in the order: earthworms &gt; bacteria &gt; nematodes &gt; fungi. The observed loss of soil biota adversely affected natural soil bioturbation, aggregate formation and stabilization, and decomposition and mineralization processes and therefore resulted in compacted soil with narrow pore size distributions and overall smaller pores, restricted air and water storage and flow, and impeded C, N, and P cycling. The simultaneous evolution of soil biodiversity and functions along the Cu gradient emphasized the key role of soil life in controlling ecosystem services. Furthermore, results indicated that different soil biodiversity and functional indicators started to decline (10% loss) within a Cu concentration range of 110 to 800 mg total Cu kg-1. © Soil Science Society of America, 5585 Guilford Rd.",,"Bacteria; Biodiversity; Copper; Fungi; Soils; Stabilization; Water pollution; Water recycling; Aggregate formation; Copper contamination; Cu concentrations; Ecosystem services; Laboratory experiments; Mineralization process; Narrow pore size distributions; Pollution gradient; Soil pollution; anthropogenic effect; bioturbation; community response; concentration (composition); copper; ecosystem function; microbial community; mineralization; nutrient cycling; plant community; pollution effect; soil biota; soil ecosystem; soil pollution; soil stabilization; species diversity; species richness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906231354

These changes in land-use are known to affect species diversity but consequences for the functional diversity of species assemblages are poorly understood. Environmental filtering of species with similar traits could lead to disproportionate reductions in trait diversity in degraded habitats. Here, we focus on dung beetles, which play a key role in ecosystem processes such as nutrient recycling and seed dispersal. We use morphological and behavioural traits to calculate a variety of functional diversity measures across a gradient of disturbance from primary forest through intensively logged forest to oil palm. Logging caused significant shifts in community composition but had very little effect on functional diversity, even after a repeated timber harvest. These data provide evidence for functional redundancy of dung beetles within primary forest and emphasize the high value of logged forests as refugia for biodiversity. In contrast, conversion of forest to oil palm greatly reduced taxonomic and functional diversity, with a marked decrease in the abundance of nocturnal foragers, a higher proportion of species with small body sizes and the complete loss of telecoprid species (dung-rollers), all indicating a decrease in the functional capacity of dung beetles within plantations. These changes also highlight the vulnerability of community functioning within logged forests in the event of further environmental degradation. © 2013 The Zoological Society of London.","Borneo; Deforestation; Ecosystem services; Habitat change; Palm oil; Tropical forest","agriculture; beetle; biodiversity; community composition; deforestation; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; environmental disturbance; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; logging (timber); tropical forest; vegetable oil; Borneo; Coleoptera; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898055660

In Africa, yields for important cereals (e.g., maize) have stagnated at 1tha-1 due to land degradation, low fertilizer use and water stress. Resource-conserving options such as agroforestry promote integrated management systems that relate livelihoods and ecosystem service functions to agricultural production. Low input practices including improved fallows using legumes in rotations or intercrops can restore soil nutrients, improve soil carbon and reduce reliance on fertilizer use by 50%.

However, small landholders are now being linked with market, grow modern varieties, use fertilizers and pesticides, and produce high yields. Improved technologies include conservation agriculture, cover cropping, water harvesting and recycling using micro-irrigation, and soil-specific farming based on the principles of precision agriculture. The principal challenges to sustainable intensification of small landholder farmers are restoring soil organic matter content, improving soil fertility, controlling soil erosion, conserving water in the root zone, and abating climate change.

This study examines Lake Hugh Muntz, a large (17 ha) freshwater lake built in Gold Coast City, Australia. A ten year water quality monitoring programme shows that the lake has increasing nutrient concentrations, and together with summer algal blooms, the lake amenity as a popular recreational swimming and triathlon training location is at risk. A survey of fish and aquatic plant communities showed that the lake supports a sub-set of species found in adjacent natural wetlands. Sediment contaminants were below the lower Australian trigger values, except As, Hg, Pb and Zn, probably a function of untreated and uncontrolled stormwater runoff from nearby urban roads. Sediment biogeochemistry showed early signs of oxygen depletion, and an increase in benthic organic matter decomposition and oxygen consumption will result in more nitrogen recycled to the water column as NH4+ (increasing the intensity of summer algal blooms) and less nitrogen lost to the atmosphere as N2 gas via denitrification. A series of catchment restoration initiatives were modeled and the optimal stormwater runoff restoration effort needed for lake protection will be costly, particularly retrospective, as is the case here. Overall, balancing the lifestyles and livelihoods of residents along with ecosystem protection are possible, but require considerable trade-offs between ecosystem services and human use. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"fresh water; lake water; nitrogen; organic matter; oxygen; storm water; nitrogen; phosphorus; water pollutant; algal bloom; Article; Australia; biochemistry; biogeochemistry; catchment; decomposition; denitrification; depletion; environmental protection; human; lake sediment; nonhuman; nutrient concentration; oxygen consumption; plant community; risk assessment; summer; swimming; triathlon; water analysis; water contamination; water pollution; water quality; wetland; analysis; animal; chemistry; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; eutrophication; lake; sediment; water pollutant; Animals; Australia; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Eutrophication; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Lakes; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912063764

However, these two influences do not work independently of each other. With two once-in-a-century-level droughts occurring in the Amazon in the past decade, it is vital to understand the feedbacks that contribute to altering the water cycle. The biogeophysical impacts of land cover change within the Amazon basin were examined under drought and pluvial conditions to investigate how land cover and drought jointly may have enhanced or diminished recent precipitation extremes by altering patterns and intensity. Using theWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model coupled to the Noah land surface model, a series of April-September simulations representing drought, normal, and pluvial years were completed to assess how land cover change impacts precipitation and how these impacts change under varied rainfall regimes. Evaporative sources of water vapor that precipitate across the region were developed with a quasi-isentropic back-trajectory algorithm to delineate the extent and variability that terrestrial evaporation contributes to regional precipitation.Adecrease in dry season latent heat flux and other impacts of deforestation on surface conditions were increased by drought conditions. Coupled with increases in dry season moisture recycling over the Amazon basin by ;7% during drought years, land cover change is capable of reducing precipitation and increasing the amplitude of droughts in the region. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.","Deforestation; Hydrologic cycle; Interannual variability; South America; Vegetation-atmosphere interactions","Drought conditions; Hydrologic cycles; Inherent variability; Interannual variability; Land surface modeling; Precipitation extremes; South America; Vegetation-atmosphere interactions; Computer simulation; Deforestation; Drought; algorithm; annual variation; deforestation; drought; evaporation; hydrological cycle; land cover; precipitation assessment; water vapor; weather forecasting; Amazon Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892473208

However, recreational tourist activities such as skiing, hiking and horse riding deteriorate the unique and vulnerable nature of Northern Finland. Erosion and wearing of tourist areas negatively affects biodiversity and ecosystem services and reduce the attractiveness of the region. Tourism is also the source of other environmental disturbances such as wastes. Currently, in Lapland, the prevalent waste treatment method is disposal, and wastes are transported over long distances due to lack of recipient facilities for waste management. The suggestion for sustainable waste management Scenario presented in this paper is to find a synergistic solution to both of these problems, by local treatment of bio-waste in an anaerobic digestor and utilization of digestate to revegetate eroded land. It is proposed that bio-waste is co-digested with sewage sludge and offal from slaughterhouses in Ylläs in the municipality of Kolari. An estimated 500-1000 t of digestate could be produced and used in tourist areas annually. Experiences from existing seasonal bio-waste collection schemes and interviews of local tourist enterprises and tourists indicate that there is willingness to extend the source separation of wastes. Assessment of the digestion Scenario suggests that economic costs of investment could be offset by avoided costs and by additional environmental and social benefits. It is concluded that this zero waste approach could lead to an improved image of Lapland as a sustainable tourist destination. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

They have been developed in response to the view that the world's current dominant economic system-i.e. capitalism-is not delivering sustainable development in its current format (for example, see: Bebbington et al., 2001; Bebbington and Gray, 2001; Howes, 2003b; Unerman et al., 2007a; Gray, 2010; and Jones, 2010). Indicators such as those contained in the 2011 United Nations Environment Programme (‘UNEP') report ‘Keeping Track of Our Changing Environment: From Rio to Rio+20' (UNEP, 2011) and the OECD ‘Environmental Outlook to 2050' report (OECD, 2012) have continued to show (or predict) worsening planetary and social health and so add urgency to this argument. The ‘Conventionon Biological Diversity-Global Diversity Outlook 3' report (CBD, 2010) has delivered the same verdict for biodiversity. In the UK, recently published indicators have also shown declining biodiversity trends (see: Lawton et al., 2010; the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (‘NEA'), 2011a; DEFRA, 2011a; and JNCC, 2012a). Per DEFRA (2011a), “although some species have shown recovery in recent years, many species, such as birds, butterflies and plants, and habitats, particularly in the wider countryside, show long term declines” (p. 9). To pick just one example, honey bees declined by 23 per cent in Wales (a country that is part of the UK and the location of the case study illustrated later in this chapter) between 1985 and 2005 (UK NEA, 2011a, p. 65). The capitalist system is seen as requiring reform as information provided by it is incorrect. Prices and costs used to make decisions at the individual, entity and macroeconomic levels are wrong, as conventional accounting does not recognise and record all consequences of economic decisions/actions (for example, see Bebbington et al., 2001; Bent and Richardson, 2003; Baxter et al., 2002, 2003; Antheaume, 2004, 2007; Jones, 2010; and Mattison et al., 2011). As an illustration, organisations will account for timber purchase costs, recording the prices charged by suppliers. However, these purchase costs will not represent fully the true cost to society of (for example) deforestation and losses to biodiversity. Non-market items without a price are often hidden and ignored (Bebbington et al., 2001; Gray and Laughlin, 2012), and this applies to most natural capital and biodiversity; use and damage are not generally accounted for at the entity level (Howes, 2000, 2002, 2003b. See also: Gray, 1992; Rubenstein, 1992, 1994; and Boone and Rubenstein, 1997). Howes (2000) defined natural capital as:the exploitable resources of the Earth's ecosystem-its oceans, forests, mountains and plains-that provide the raw material inputs, resources and flows of energy into our productive processes. It also consists of a range of ‘ecosystem services'. These services include the provision of an atmosphere and a stable climate, a protective ozone layer, and the absorptive capacities to disperse, neutralize and recycle the material outputs and pollution generated in ever-increasing quantities from our global economic activities. © 2014 selection and editorial material, Michael Jones; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087264176

The need for a robust, scientifically rigorous evidence base for effective policy planning and practice has never been greater. Environmental change includes, but is not limited to, climate change; it also includes land-use and land-cover change, including deforestation for agriculture, and occurs alongside changes in anthropogenic interventions that are used in natural resource management such as the regulation of river flows using dams, which can have impacts that frequently exceed those arising in the natural system. In this paper, we examine the role that land surface models can play in providing a robust scientific basis for making resource management decisions against a background of environmental change.We provide some perspectives on recent developments in modelling in land surface hydrology. Among the range of current land surface and hydrology models, there is a large range of variability, which indicates that the specification and parametrization of several basic processes in the models can be improved. Key areas that require improvement in order to address hydrological applications include (i) the representation of groundwater in models, particularly at the scales relevant to land surfacemodelling, (ii) the representation of human interventions such as dams and irrigation in the hydrological system, (iii) the quantification and communication of uncertainty, and (iv) improved understanding of the impact on water resources availability of multiple use through treatment, recycling and return flows (and the balance of consumptive and conservative uses). Through a series of examples, we demonstrate that changes in water use could have important reciprocal impacts on climate over a wide area. The effects of water management decisions on climate feedbacks are only beginning to be investigated- they are still only rarely included in climate impact assessments-and the links between the hydrological system and climate are rarely acknowledged in studies of ecosystem services. Nevertheless, because water is essential not only for its direct uses but also for the indirect functions that it serves (including food production, fisheries and industry), it is vital that these connected systems are studied. Building on the examples above, we highlight recent research showing that assessment of these trade-offs is particularly complex in wetland areas, especially in situations where these trade-offs play to the advantage of different communities. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Quantity and quality of the SOC pool are essential to soil quality, agronomic production, and use efficiency of inputs. Furthermore, limiting global warming to a 2°C increase in Earth's mean temperature requires the identification of appropriate sinks for atmospheric CO2. Sequestration of C in soils is almost an obvious climate solution, which ironically has been overlooked by policy makers. Yet, it is a proverbial ""low-hanging"" fruit with numerous co-benefits. Most soils of the agroecosystems are depleted of their antecedent SOC pool by 25%-75%, equivalent to 10-30 Mg/ha, which is also the technical sink capacity of C sequestration. The rate of SOC sequestration in soils of the tropics and subtropics is 100-500 kg/ha/year. The potential global soil C sink capacity is 1.2-3.1 Pg C/year, 25-50 years. While mitigating climate change, an increase in SOC pool also enhances crop yield because of improvements in soil physical (i.e., aggregation, available water capacity), chemical (i.e., cation and anion exchange capacity [CEC/AEC], soil reaction, nutrient transformation), and biological properties (i.e., microbial biomass C earthworm activity). The adoption of conservation-effective measures can avoid erosion-induced emissions by minimizing decomposition of SOC transported by erosional processes. The mean residence time of SOC depends on a range of exogenous and endogenous factors. Recommended management practices (RMPs) for SOC concentration include conservation agriculture based on no-till and mulch farming, use of cover crops and green manure, application of manure and biochar, and use of perennial culture, including agroforestry. Balanced application of fertilizers is crucial. Water conservation, water harvesting and recycling, use of drip subirrigation, and growing aerobic rice are some important practices for enhancing water-use efficiency. There is a strong need for research in understanding processes of SOC sequestration, identifying and validating soil-/site-specific agronomic practices, and making policy interventions that reward farmers through payments for ecosystem services. Farming C and trading C credits are needed to create another income stream for farmers and to promote the adoption of RMPs. Cropland soils of south Asia in general and those of the Indo-Gangetic Plain in particular are severely depleted of their SOC pool. Despite high inputs of fertilizers and water, crop yields are either stagnating or declining because of the ever-declining use efficiency of inputs (i.e., fertilizers, irrigation, high-yielding varieties) and degrading soils and water resources. A low SOC concentration of cropland soils (0.1%-0.5% in the plow layer of 0-20-cm depth) is the principal cause of decline in soil quality (e.g., low aggregation and plant available water capacity). Thus, RMPs that create a positive soil C budget and enhance the SOC pool must be identified. The balanced use of fertilizers and the application of farm yard manure and other biosolids (i.e., crop residues, green manure) are essential to SOC sequestration, improving the input-use efficiency, and increasing crop yields. There is a strong and positive correlation between the SOC pool in the root zone and the grain yield of wheat, maize, soybean, and other crops. The adoption of RMPs, which enhance SOC pools and sustain high agronomic yield, necessitates payments to farmers for providing ecosystem services through the trading of C credits and so on. Farming C is an important strategy to mitigate climate change, advance food security, and improve the environment. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation; carbon budget; carbon credits; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem services; food security; managed ecosystem; management practices; mitigation; soil organic carbon; soil quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888028359

Currently more than half of the global population reside in cities which influence the global biogeochemical cycles and climate change, substantially exacerbating pressures on urban pollution, water quality and food security, as well as operating costs for infrastructure development. Goods and services such as aesthetic values, water purification, nutrient recycling, and biological diversity, that urban ecosystems generate for the society, are critical to sustain. Urban planners are increasingly facing the considerable challenges of management issues for urban ecosystems. Poor understanding of the complementary roles of urban ecology in urban infrastructure, and the functioning of ecosystems and ecological resilience of a complex human-dominated landscape has impeded effective urban planning over time, resulting in social disharmony. Here a complementary framework for urban ecology is proposed, in which ecosystems interact with land use, architecture and urban design - ""E-LAUD"" - affecting ecosystem and human health, and building on the concept that land uses in urban green areas, road-strips, wetlands, 'habitat islands' and urban architecture could synergistically benefit when clustered together in different combinations of urban landscapes. It is proposed that incorporation of the E-LAUD framework in urban planning forms the context of a new interdisciplinary research programme on ecological resilience for urban ecosystems and helps promote ecosystem services. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","Complementary framework; Ecological resilience; Landscape design and architecture; Urban ecology","architectural design; biogeochemical cycle; complementarity; ecosystem resilience; global change; human activity; interdisciplinary approach; landscape change; socioeconomic impact; urban ecosystem; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888054871

Habitat restoration projects may mitigate some of these challenges, but new strategies will be needed to maintain or enhance ecosystem health while simultaneously meeting human needs. Recycled water is a reliable water source that can be used both directly and indirectly to renew degraded urban stream ecosystems. In this review, aspects of hydrology, water quality, and ecosystem services in relation to water reuse for urban stream renewal are evaluated to identify research needs and design considerations for new systems. Use of recycled water for streamflow augmentation in urban areas remains largely unexplored scientifically, despite its potential widespread applications among water and wastewater utilities. To move this innovative concept toward implementation, experimental studies in stream microcosms are needed to examine ecological response to coupled modification of both hydrology and water quality. Appropriate methods for selecting potential sites for urban stream renewal should be identified, along with ecological and economic metrics for evaluating success. Examples of projects in California, Japan, Israel, and Spain are used to identify different management scenarios. However, design criteria from both successful and unsuccessful case studies require additional review and synthesis to develop robust guidelines for recycled water use in urban stream renewal. Motivations for past stream renewal projects include regulatory requirements for water quality improvement and endangered species protection, although these motivations alone may not be enough to facilitate widespread adoption of reusing wastewater for ecosystem enhancement. Consequently, future project designs should include more detailed ecosystem service valuations to describe broader societal benefits and attract the attention of government agencies and private organizations that ultimately make the choice between environmental perturbation or enhancement. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","critical review; ecosystem renewal; natural system enhancement; recycled water; streamflow augmentation","Critical review; Ecological and economic; Environmental perturbations; Natural systems; Recycled water; Regulatory requirements; Streamflow augmentation; Water quality improvements; Ecosystems; Hydrology; Motivation; Rivers; Stream flow; Urban growth; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water quality; Water supply; Water recycling; alga; Amphibia; article; benthos; endangered species; environmental management; fish; hydrology; Israel; Japan; microcosm; nonhuman; practice guideline; reptile; stream (river); United States; urban area; waste water management; waste water recycling; water quality; water temperature; zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887783408

These animals are responsible for important ecosystem services such as recycling nutrients and improving water clarity. Under this view a better knowledge on the biological features of these animals is extremely important for future conservation and management actions. In this study the reproductive and gametogenic cycle of Anodonta anatina were studied during 2 years in one population as well as the sex ratio and hermaphroditism in six distinct populations, using standard histology. Gametogenesis was continuous in both sexes and germinal epithelium in early stages of development. Gametes were present throughout the reproductive cycle. Oogenesis and spermatogenesis occurred mainly between January and May. Larvae brooding occurred between September and March and main glochidia discharge occurred over a short period (2-3 weeks) in March. For the sex-ratio and hermaphroditism assessments a variable number of individuals were collected from several populations from lakes and rivers. Previous studies described A. anatina as mainly dioecious with only a few populations presenting occasional hermaphroditism. However, the present study indicates that A. anatina sexual behavior is influenced by environmental conditions, being mainly dioecious in rivers with increased hermaphroditism in standing waters. Although self-fertilization was not confirmed, additional studies with molecular characterization of larvae using fast evolving markers should be used in future studies to enlighten this process. Overall, this study indicates that for more efficient conservation actions and management plans, freshwater mussel reproductive biology should be studied at the population level mainly in the subfamily Anodontinae. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"fresh water; animal; Anodonta; article; disorder of sex development; ecosystem; female; genetics; growth, development and aging; male; population density; population dynamics; reproduction; sex ratio; Animals; Anodonta; Disorders of Sex Development; Ecosystem; Female; Fresh Water; Male; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Sex Ratio; Animalia; Anodonta; Anodonta anatina; Anodontinae; Glochidia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880252998

Central to this are the problems of excessive nutrient mining. If agriculture is to balance the needs of food security with the delivery of other ecosystem services, then current rates of soil nutrient stripping must be reduced and the use of synthetic fertilisers made more efficient. We explore the global extent of the problem, with specific emphasis on the failure of macronutrient management (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus) to deliver continued improvements in yield and the failure of agriculture to recognise the seriousness of micronutrient depletion (e.g. copper, zinc, selenium). Nutrient removals associated with the relatively immature, nutrient-rich soils of the UK are contrasted with the mature, nutrient-poor soils of India gaining insight into the emerging issue of nutrient stripping and the long-term implications for human health and soil quality. Whilst nutrient deficiencies are rare in developed countries, micronutrient deficiencies are commonly increasing in less-developed countries. Increasing rates of micronutrient depletion are being inadvertently accomplished through increasing crop yield potential and nitrogen fertiliser applications. Amongst other factors, the spatial disconnects caused by the segregation and industrialisation of livestock systems, between rural areas (where food is produced) and urban areas (where food is consumed and human waste treated) are identified as a major constraint to sustainable nutrient recycling. Synthesis and applications. This study advocates that agricultural sustainability can only be accomplished using a whole-systems approach that thoroughly considers nutrient stocks, removals, exports and recycling. Society needs to socially and environmentally re-engineer agricultural systems at all scales. It is suggested that this will be best realised by national-scale initiatives. Failure to do so will lead to an inevitable and rapid decline in the delivery of provisioning services within agricultural systems.

Failure to do so will lead to an inevitable and rapid decline in the delivery of provisioning services within agricultural systems. © 2013 British Ecological Society.","Agro-ecosystem functioning; Green Revolution; Intensification; Provisioning; Sustainability; Wastewater; Water quality","alternative agriculture; crop yield; farming system; fertilizer application; food security; global perspective; green revolution; national planning; nutrient cycling; recycling; soil conservation; soil management; soil nutrient; water quality; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880324491

We focus on the value of three regulating services, namely flood control, water supply and nutrient recycling. We construct a database containing 66 value estimates, mainly for wetlands in the US and Europe but also a substantial number in developing countries. Values are standardised to USD per hectare per year. The mean (median) values are found to be 6923 (427). USD/ha/yr for flood control; 3389 (57). USD/ha/yr for water supply; and 5788 (243). USD/ha/yr for nutrient recycling. The values of these services are highly variable across individual wetland sites due to, amongst other factors, differences in wetland type, size, the scarcity or abundance of other wetlands in the surrounding landscape, and the socio-economic characteristics of the beneficiaries of these services. We include explanatory variables in the meta-analysis to account for these influences on estimated wetland values. GIS is used to quantify potentially important spatial variables. The meta-regression is used to produce a value function for wetland regulating services, which can be used to transfer values to other wetland sites while controlling for site and context specific characteristics. An illustrative value transfer exercise is conducted to estimate global values for wetland regulating services in agricultural landscapes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural landscapes; Meta-analysis; Regulating services; Valuation; Wetlands","Agricultural landscapes; Economic valuation; Ecosystem services; Explanatory variables; Meta-analysis; Nutrient recycling; Regulating services; Spatial variables; Agriculture; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Flood control; Floods; Nutrients; Recycling; Resource valuation; Water supply; Wetlands; abundance; agricultural land; developing world; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; flood control; GIS; meta-analysis; recycling; valuation; water supply; wetland; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878528587

Surprisingly, animal farming systems have so far been ignored in most agroecological thinking. On the basis of a study by Altieri, who identified the key ecological processes to be optimized, we propose five principles for the design of sustainable animal production systems: (i) adopting management practices aiming to improve animal health, (ii) decreasing the inputs needed for production, (iii) decreasing pollution by optimizing the metabolic functioning of farming systems, (iv) enhancing diversity within animal production systems to strengthen their resilience and (v) preserving biological diversity in agroecosystems by adapting management practices. We then discuss how these different principles combine to generate environmental, social and economic performance in six animal production systems (ruminants, pigs, rabbits and aquaculture) covering a long gradient of intensification. The two principles concerning economy of inputs and reduction of pollution emerged in nearly all the case studies, a finding that can be explained by the economic and regulatory constraints affecting animal production. Integrated management of animal health was seldom mobilized, as alternatives to chemical drugs have only recently been investigated, and the results are not yet transferable to farming practices. A number of ecological functions and ecosystem services (recycling of nutrients, forage yield, pollination, resistance to weed invasion, etc.) are closely linked to biodiversity, and their persistence depends largely on maintaining biological diversity in agroecosystems. We conclude that the development of such ecology-based alternatives for animal production implies changes in the positions adopted by technicians and extension services, researchers and policymakers. Animal production systems should not only be considered holistically, but also in the diversity of their local and regional conditions. The ability of farmers to make their own decisions on the basis of the close monitoring of system performance is most important to ensure system sustainability.

A growing number of studies have also shown various effects of carrion on different plant and microbial communities. However, there has been no review of these studies to bring this information together and identify priority areas for future research. We review carrion ecology studies from the last two decades and summarise the range of spatial and temporal effects of carrion on soil nutrients, microbes, plants, arthropods, and vertebrates. We identify key knowledge gaps in carrion ecology, and discuss how closing these gaps can be achieved by focusing future research on the (1) different kinds of carrion resources, (2) interactions between different components of the carrion community, (3) the ways that ecosystem context can moderate carrion effects, and (4) considerations for carrion management. To guide this research, we outline a framework that builds on the 'ephemeral resource patch' concept, and helps to structure research questions that link localised effects of carrion with their consequences at landscape scales. This will enable improved characterisation of carrion as a unique resource pool, provide answers for land managers in a position to influence carrion availability, and establish the ways that carrion affects the dynamics of species diversity and ecological processes within landscapes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Animal; Cadaver; Carcass; Detritus; Nutrient cycling; Spatial; Temporal","arthropod; biodiversity; carrion; detritus; ecosystem service; microbial community; nutrient cycling; plant community; recycling; soil nutrient; spatiotemporal analysis; species diversity; vertebrate; Animalia; Arthropoda; Vertebrata",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875682036

However, the effect of grassland degradation on ecosystem services and the consequence of grassland deterioration on economic loss still remains a mystery. So, in this study, we assessed four types of ecosystem services following the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment classification, along a degradation gradient. Five sites of alpine grassland at different levels of degradation were investigated in Guoluo Prefecture of Qinghai Province, China. The species composition, aboveground biomass, soil total organic carbon (TOC), and soil total nitrogen (TN) were tested to evaluate major ecological services of the alpine grassland. We estimated the value of primary production, carbon storage, nitrogen recycling, and plant diversity. The results show the ecosystem services of alpine grassland varied along the degradation gradient. The ecosystem services of degraded grassland (moderate, heavy and severe) were all significantly lower than non-degraded grassland. Interestingly, the lightly degraded grassland provided more economic benefit from carbon maintenance and nutrient sequestration compared to non-degraded. Due to the destruction of the alpine grassland, the economic loss associated with decrease of biomass in 2008 was $198/ha. Until 2008, the economic loss caused by carbon emissions and nitrogen loss on severely degraded grassland was up to $8 033/ha and $13 315/ha, respectively. Urgent actions are required to maintain or promote the ecosystem services of alpine grassland in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. © 2013 Wen et al.",,"carbon; nitrogen; organic carbon; article; biomass; carbon storage; climate change; ecosystem; endangered species; environmental change; grassland; human; soil quality; Altitude; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; China; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Poaceae; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874584100

Land misuse and soil mismanagement can degrade soil quality, and either reduces quantity and quality of ecosystem services or leads to disservices and creates large ecological footprints. By increasing the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, soil biological, chemical and physical quality can be improved which in turn improves ecosystem services.

Changes in these interactions may influence ecosystem functioning. Links between plant functional diversity, soil microbial communities and ecosystem functioning have been demonstrated in experiments using plant monocultures and mixtures, using broad plant and microbial functional groups, but have not been examined in diverse natural plant communities. We quantified the relative effects of plant and microbial functional properties on key ecosystem functions. We measured plant functional diversity, soil microbial community composition and parameters associated with nitrogen (N) cycling and key nutrient cycling processes at three grassland sites in different parts of Europe. Because plant structure and function strongly influence soil microbial communities, we determined relationships between ecosystem properties, plant traits and soil community characteristics following a sequential approach in which plant traits were fitted first, followed by the additional effects of soil micro-organisms. We identified a continuum from standing green biomass and standing litter, linked mostly with plant traits, to potential N mineralization and potential leaching of soil inorganic N, linked mostly with microbial properties. Plant and microbial functional parameters were equally important in explaining % organic matter content in soil. A parallel continuum ran from plant height, linked with above-ground biomass, to plant quality effects captured by the leaf economics spectrum, which were linked with the recycling of carbon (C) and N. More exploitative species (higher specific leaf area, leaf N concentrations and lower leaf dry matter content) and taller swards, along with soil microbial communities dominated by bacteria, with rapid microbial activities, were linked with greater fodder production, but poor C and N retention. Conversely, dominance by conservative species (with opposite traits) and soil microbial communities dominated by fungi, and bacteria with slow activities, were usually linked with low production, but greater soil C storage and N retention. Synthesis - Grassland production, C sequestration and soil N retention are jointly related to plant and microbial functional traits. Managing grasslands for selected, or multiple, ecosystem services will thus require a consideration of the joint effects of plant and soil communities. Further understanding of the mechanisms that link plant and microbial functional traits is essential to achieve this. © 2013 The Authors.

At any given time, an ecosystem provides a 'flow' of diverse services, depending upon the type of ecosystem and its condition, as well as how it is managed.1 The value of some ecosystem benefits, such as food, fiber, and fuel, is captured in financial markets and thus easily recognized. Other services are less apparent and thus taken for granted because they are of a 'public good' nature, accruing directly to humans without passing through a market exchange.2 This is particularly true of the natural processes underlying and sustaining the provision of environmental goods and services. Consider a square meter of Danish pasture soil in which researchers identified more than 50,000 worms, 48,000 small insects, and 10 million nematodes. A soil ecosystem such as this provides a range of critical services: The recycling of dead organic matter and breakdown and disposal of wastes; the renewal of soil fertility, physical support, and the supply of nutrients and water for plants that, in turn, buffer and moderate the hydrological cycle and provide food for animals and humans.3 Our agricultural systems are utterly dependent upon healthy soil ecosystems and yet most of these environmental services are unrecognized and thus undervalued by society. Similarly, few consumers are aware of the many ecosystem services that contribute to the production of clean water. Consumers pay utilities or municipalities for the services of capturing, treating, and delivering water, but not for producing the water. Healthy watersheds or aquifers provide clean water through ecosystem services such as flow regulation, filtration, flood control, and protection against runoff, erosion, sedimentation, and evaporation. While the service of water purification might be partially substituted for by technology, a forested watershed provides this and a variety of other benefits, such carbon storage, fisheries maintenance, recreation, and aesthetic fulfillment, usually at a fraction of the cost of building a water treatment facility. Although economists and environmental scientists have discussed the concept of ecosystem services for decades, private and public-sector decisions about land and resource use often ignore the value of less tangible ecosystem services because they are underpriced-or not priced at all-in markets. As a result, policies and practices that protect and enhance the flow of multiple benefits from ecosystems lag behind the degradation of these services, leading to inefficient and unsustainable resource use. This is due, in part, to 'immature markets' that fail to value environmental goods or services that are not formally bought or sold5 and a lack of information on the ecological value of these flows that can be readily used to inform decision making. The development of common metrics for communicating the value of ecosystem services has been critical to more fully assessing the benefits and costs to society of natural resource use and management decisions. However, even when more information is available, there are trade-offs associated with managing for different ecosystem services, and often there is less incentive to manage for nonmarket environmental values. In this chapter, we discuss two critical components for improved ecosystem management: effective communication about the value to society of environmental service flows and financial incentives to manage for nonmarket environmental values. Ecosystem service (ES) indicators condense complex information about environmental flows and their ecological status into information that can be easily communicated.6 Economists can then utilize this information to develop monetary values for these services provided by nature. Ecosystem service valuation employs different economic approaches or methodologies in evaluating environmental services for which no market prices exist. In this manner, the valuation of ecosystem services requires a multidiscipline approach resulting in findings that can be useful for land managers, policy makers and others. The combination of environmental indicators and economic analysis methodologies can be highly effective at communicating the state of, and value derived from, ecosystem service flows. One application of the findings from this type of research is in developing incentives for protecting, conserving, or enhancing ecosystem services. Payment for Ecosystem Service (PES) programs offer a mechanism for translating nonmarket utility (benefits) derived from ecosystems into appropriate financial incentives for local actors to provide environmental services.7 Using examples, we demonstrate how ES indicators, economic valuation, and PES programs contribute to ecosystem management that sustains and enhances the flow of environmental services.

Given the economic value, it is not surprising that billions of dollars are spent annually to protect, preserve, restore and conserve natural resources. Resilience describes the ability of ecological systems to recover from disturbance. Resilient ecosystems remain productive and thus maintain services including biophysical processes that are important for human well-being. Four system-wide characteristics, or biophysical signatures are reviewed, at least one of which is required to relate ecosystem structure or function to resilience. Biophysical signatures include (a) variable material and energy recycling, (b) biodiversity, (c) the rate of governing processes, and (d) bioenergetics. Fast recycling rates encourage ecosystem stability by dampening oscillations while slow recycling rates increase resistance by weakly propagating disturbances. The role of biodiversity in stabilizing ecosystems may be viewed as either a functional redundancy where increased diversity resists perturbation by maintaining key ecosystem functions, or as response diversity that ensures recovery processes. Governing ecosystem processes that respond slowly, such as those involving large storage reservoirs, resist perturbation and shift to alternative states. Several observational resilience studies featured bioenergetics as both the perturbation force (i.e., predation, food supply) and the thermodynamic orientor that organizes recovery (i.e., maximizing exergy storage). An energy balance approach is proposed as a possible method to assess ecosystem stability. Validating a mechanistic resilience model against high resolution data collected from a system undergoing regime shift is needed to advance theory toward practical application. As physical requirements bound the possibility space for ecosystems, it is not surprising that biophysical processes play a central role in resilience theory. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Biophysics; Ecosystem, Stability, Energy balance; Resilience","Alternative state; Biophysical process; Ecological systems; Economic values; Ecosystem functions; Ecosystem process; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem stability; Ecosystem structure; Energy recycling; Functional redundancy; High resolution data; Possibility space; Propagating disturbances; Recovery process; Recycling rate; Regime shift; Resilience; Resilience model; Storage reservoirs; Biochemistry; Biodiversity; Biophysics; Conservation; Digital storage; Energy balance; Food supply; Recovery; Recycling; Ecosystems; biodiversity; bioenergetics; conservation management; disturbance; ecosystem function; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; ecosystem structure; energy balance; food supply; model validation; natural resource",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868593966

This is agriculture that makes efficient use of natural resources and does not degrade the environmental systems that underpin it, or deplete natural capital stocks. We convened a group of 29 'practitioners' and 17 environmental scientists with direct involvement or expertise in the environmental sustainability of agriculture. The practitioners included representatives from UK industry, non-government organizations and government agencies. We collaboratively developed a long list of 264 knowledge needs to help enhance the environmental sustainability of agriculture within the UK or for the UK market. We refined and selected the most important knowledge needs through a three-stage process of voting, discussion and scoring. Scientists and practitioners identified similar priorities. We present the 26 highest priority knowledge needs. Many of them demand integration of knowledge from different disciplines to inform policy and practice. The top five are about sustainability of livestock feed, trade-offs between ecosystem services at farm or landscape scale, phosphorus recycling and metrics to measure sustainability. The outcomes will be used to guide ongoing knowledge exchange work, future science policy and funding. © 2013 by the authors.","Agriculture; Environment; Farming; Food; Knowledge gaps; Retail; Sustainability","agricultural production; alternative agriculture; ecosystem service; environmental change; environmental economics; food security; global perspective; indigenous knowledge; natural capital; retailing; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882964047

On the other hand, parks, recreation grounds, gardens, green roofs and in general 'green infrastructure', provide a range of (urban) ecosystem services (including quality of life and aesthetics) and could also be thought of as inter alia contributors to the mitigation of floods, droughts, noise, air pollution and urban heat island (UHI) effects, improvement of biodiversity, amenity values and human health. Currently, these 'blue' and 'green' assets/infrastructure are planned to operate as two separate systems despite the obvious interactions between them (for example, low runoff coefficient of green areas resulting in reduction of stormwater flows, and irrigation of green areas by potable water in increasing pressure on water supply systems). This study explores the prospects of a more integrated 'blue-green' approach - tested at the scale of a household. Specifically, UWOT (the Urban Water Optioneering Tool) was extended and used to assess the potential benefits of a scheme that employed locally treated greywater along with harvested rainwater for irrigating a green roof. The results of the simulations indicated that the blue-green approach combined the benefits of both 'green' and 'blue' technologies/services and at the same time minimised the disadvantages of each when installed separately.© IWA Publishing 2013 Water Science and Technology: Water Supply.","Blue-green approach; Green roofs; Local treatment; Rainwater harvesting; Urban heat island effect; Urban water modelling","Atmospheric temperature; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Heating; Roofs; Runoff; Water resources; Water supply; Water supply systems; Blue-green approach; Green roof; Local treatment; Rain water harvesting; Urban Heat Island Effects; Urban waters; Potable water; drinking water; rain; runoff; storm water; ecosystem service; environmental management; heat island; infrastructure planning; integrated approach; quality of life; rainwater; recycling; roof; stormwater; urban area; vegetation cover; water management; water quality; water storage; water supply; water treatment; air pollution; article; biodiversity; blue green approach; city; drought; ecosystem; environmental protection; flooding; household; noise; pressure; public health; quality of life; recreation; simulation; urban area; urban water optioneering tool; water management; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889577917

We examined how resource provisioning (nutrient recycling), mediated by native freshwater mussels, influences the structure and function of benthic communities by combining observational data and a field experiment. We compared the following: (1) elemental and community composition (algal pigments and macroinvertebates) on live mussel shells and on nearby rocks across a gradient of catchment agriculture and (2) experimental colonisation of benthic communities on live vs. sham shells controlling for initial community composition and colonisation duration. We show that in near pristine systems, nutrient heterogeneity mediated by mussels relates to greater biodiversity of communities, which supports the notion that resource heterogeneity can foster biological diversity. However, with increased nutrients from the catchment, the relevance of mussel-provisioned nutrients was nearly eliminated. While species can persist in disturbed systems, their functional relevance may be diminished or lost. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.","Agricultural land use; Aquatic ecosystem; Biodiversity; Ecosystem function; Ecosystem services; Environmental context; Environmental gradient; Food web; Niche construction; Nitrogen; Resource provisioning","algae; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931749045

In both kinds of system, resources are processed by a number of users within a network, but we consider ecosystems as the only ones displaying sustainable patterns of growth and development. This study aims at using Network Analysis (NA) to move such "" ecosystem perspective"" from theory into practice. A Danish municipal Water Management System (WMS) is used as case study to test the NA methodology and to discuss its generic applicability. We identified water users within the WMS and represented their interactions as a network of water flows. We computed intensive and extensive indices of system-level performance for seven different network configurations illustrating past conditions (2004-2008) and future scenarios (2015 and 2020). We also computed the same indices for other 24 human systems and for 12 ecosystems, by using information from the existing scientific literature on NA. The comparison of these results reveals that the WMS is similar to the other human systems and that human systems generally differ from ecosystems. The WMS is highly efficient at processing the water resource, but the rigid and almost linear structure makes it vulnerable in situations of stress such as heavy rain events. The analysis of future scenarios showed a trend towards increased sustainability, but differences between past and expected future performance of the WMS are marginal. We argue that future interventions should create alternative pathways for reusing rainwater within the WMS, increasing its potential to withstand the occurrence of flooding. We discuss advantages, limitations, and general applicability of NA as a tool for assessing environmental sustainability in human systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Ecosystem perspective; Efficiency and resilience; Growth and development; Network Analysis; System indicators; Water management","rain; ecosystem service; environmental indicator; flooding; network analysis; rainwater; recycling; resource use; sustainability; water management; water resource; article; ecosystem; environmental sustainability; flood tide; human; network analysis; water flow; water management; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873258446

This is not surprising given the estimated diversity of up to 106species of bacteria per g of soil. The soil biota play key roles in ecosystem functions and hence in ecosystem services provided to humans, such as sustaining primary productivity through recycling plant nutrients and pest control. Soil biodiversity in turn depends on plants, directly through the infl uence by living plants and indirectly by after-life effects of dead plants, as primary producers provide energy and nutrients and create soil habitats. The soil food web (comprising bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, soil fauna) itself represents only about 2 % of the total organic soil carbon yet it is central to soil carbon (C) sequestration through its impact on soil C turnover and stabilization by chemical and physical processes. However, how much or which soil biodiversity is needed to promote soil C sequestration remains an open question, yet key to develop management strategies for promoting soil C sequestration and biodiversity. Soils are of major importance in terms of ecosystem C given that terrestrial ecosystems contain more than 2,100 Pg organic C globally of which 1,500 Pg is located in soil. Moreover soils can serve as C source, i.e. C loss, or C sink, i.e. C sequestration in soil, and this balance is strongly dependent on soil management and soil biodiversity. Here we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the interdependency of soil biodiversity and ecosystem/soil C through interactions with primary producers. Overall most studies found that soil functional composition rather than species richness per se regulates soil C sequestration, through promoting ecosystem nutrient use efficiency, soil (micro)aggregate formation and soil depth development. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Ecosystem engineers; Ecosystem functioning; Functional groups; Key species; Nutrient use efficiency; Soil biota; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil microbes; Soil structure; Stoichiometry","Agronomy; Animals; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Functional groups; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Soils; Stoichiometry; Ecosystem engineer; Ecosystem functioning; Key species; Nutrient-use efficiencies; Soil biota; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil microbes; Soil structure; Stabilization",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948671032

Desertification affects large dryland areas around the world and is a major cause of stress in human societies. Here we review recent research on the drivers, feedbacks, and impacts of desertification. A multidisciplinary approach to understanding the drivers and feedbacks of global desertification is motivated by our increasing need to improve global food production and to sustainably manage ecosystems in the context of climate change. Classic desertification theories look at this process as a transition between stable states in bistable ecosystem dynamics. Climate change (i.e., aridification) and land use dynamics are the major drivers of an ecosystem shift to a "" desertified"" (or "" degraded"" ) state. This shift is typically sustained by positive feedbacks, which stabilize the system in the new state. Desertification feedbacks may involve land degradation processes (e.g., nutrient loss or salinization), changes in rainfall regime resulting from land-atmosphere interactions (e.g., precipitation recycling, dust emissions), or changes in plant community composition (e.g., shrub encroachment, decrease in vegetation cover). We analyze each of these feedback mechanisms and discuss their possible enhancement by interactions with socio-economic drivers. Large scale effects of desertification include the emigration of "" environmental refugees"" displaced from degraded areas, climatic changes, and the alteration of global biogeochemical cycles resulting from the emission and long-range transport of fine mineral dust. Recent research has identified some possible early warning signs of desertification, which can be used as indicators of resilience loss and imminent shift to desert-like conditions. We conclude with a brief discussion on some desertification control strategies implemented in different regions around the world. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Desertification; Ecohydrology; Feedbacks; Land degradation; Overgrazing; Soil salinity","Desertification; Eco-hydrology; Land degradation; Overgrazing; Soil salinity; Climate change; Dynamics; Economics; Ecosystems; Rain; Vegetation; Feedback; biogeochemical cycle; climate change; desertification; ecohydrology; ecosystem dynamics; ecosystem management; land degradation; long range transport; overgrazing; salinity; soil property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872832389

This vast ocean nurtured life’s beginnings and continues to support the biosphere and ultimately humanity. Approximately a quarter of the world’s population lives along coastlines where people extract food, building materials, energy, cultural signicance and income (Seto and Shepherd, 2009). Oceans are also important in connecting and transporting people and materials over great distances through coastal and ocean-going shipping. In the current period of rapid global change, oceans play a critical role by absorbing around 30 per cent of the carbon dioxide from anthropogenic sources and over 90 per cent of the heat generated by the associated enhanced greenhouse effect (IPCC, 2007). Without the ocean, climate change would be far more severe than it is today. Australia is a maritime country with sovereign rights over an ocean territory that covers 16 million km2 - almost twice the size of its land area. This ocean area supports industries which are extremely valuable to Australia and yield economic wealth estimated as $A42 billion per annum while the ecosystem services provided by Australia’s oceans may yield a further $25 billion per annum (AIMS, 2012). Recreational shing (supported by over $A3.3 billion in boat purchases alone), surng (for instance, worth $A126-233 million per annum merely along Queensland’s Gold Coast) and Great Barrier Reef tourism (which generates over $A6 billion per annum) are a few examples of the direct benets that marine resources provide to the Australian economy (Poloczanska et al., 2007). In addition to the direct nancial benets to the Australian economy, our marine ecosystems also provide a wide array of other values, including social and lifestyle benets, and indirect yet critically important services such as coastal protection, shoreline stabilization, greenhouse gas regulation, nutrient recycling and the maintenance of water quality (Poloczanska et al., 2007, Martinez et al., 2007). Marine resources play an important role regionally. Many countries in the Asia and the Indo-Pacic region have large populations that reside along their coasts (Martinez et al., 2007). For instance, over 60 per cent of Indonesia’s population lives along its 95,181 km of coastline (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2009), a proportion which increases to around 95 per cent for the island countries of the Indo-Pacic (CIA, 2010). Marine resources, consequently, are central to the well-being and food security of people throughout South-East Asia and the Indo-Pacic region. Risks posed by climate change to the economies, livelihoods and security of the region will impact Australia, given Australia’s economic and development role in the South Pacic region. © 2013 Peter Christoff, selection and editorial material; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086958230

For example, bumblebees, solitary bees and honeybees, are crucial to the pollination of many of the world's crops and wildflowers, with over 70% of the world's major food crops dependent on the pollination services provided by these insects. The larvae of some butterfly species are considered to be pests; however, together with moth and sawfly larvae, they represent a key dietary component for many farmland birds. Spiders and ground beetles predate on crop pests including aphids, whilst soil macrofauna such as earthworms are vital for soil fertility services and nutrient recycling. Despite their importance, population declines of invertebrates have been observed during the last sixty years in the UK and NW Europe. For example, seven UK bumblebee species are in decline, and in the last 20 years, the species Bombus subterraneus (short-haired bumblebee) has become extinct, whilst there was a 54% decline in honeybee colony numbers in England from 1985 to 2005. Comparable trends have been documented for butterflies with a 23% decline in UK farmland species such as Anthocharis cardamines (orange tip) between 1990 and 2007. These declines have been widely attributed to the modern intensive arable management practices that have been developed to maximise crop yield. For example, loss and fragmentation of foraging and nesting habitats, including species-rich meadows and hedgerows, have been implicated in the decline of bees and butterflies. Increased use of herbicides and fertilisers has caused detrimental effects on many plant species with negative consequences for predatory invertebrates such as spiders and beetles which rely on plants for food and shelter. © 2012 Research Information Ltd.

The general goal of these projects was to improve our understanding of how the response of arctic marine ecosystems to climate warming will alter food web structure and ecosystem services provided to Northerners. At least four key findings from these projects relating to arctic heterotrophic food web, pelagic-benthic coupling and biodiversity have emerged: (1) Contrary to a long-standing paradigm of dormant ecosystems during the long arctic winter, major food web components showed relatively high level of winter activity, well before the spring release of ice algae and subsequent phytoplankton bloom. Such phenological plasticity among key secondary producers like zooplankton may thus narrow the risks of extreme mismatch between primary production and secondary production in an increasingly variable arctic environment. (2) Tight pelagic-benthic coupling and consequent recycling of nutrients at the seafloor characterize specific regions of the Canadian Arctic, such as the North Water polynya and Lancaster Sound. The latter constitute hot spots of benthic ecosystem functioning compared to regions where zooplankton-mediated processes weaken the pelagic-benthic coupling. (3) In contrast with another widely shared assumption of lower biodiversity, arctic marine biodiversity is comparable to that reported off Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Canada, albeit threatened by the potential colonization of subarctic species. (4) The rapid decrease of summer sea-ice cover allows increasing numbers of killer whales to use the Canadian High Arctic as a hunting ground. The stronger presence of this species, bound to become a new apex predator of arctic seas, will likely affect populations of endemic arctic marine mammals such as the narwhal, bowhead, and beluga whales. © 2012 The Author(s).",,"Arctic marine; Arctic Sea; Beluga whales; Benthic ecosystems; Canadian Arctic; Climate warming; Ecosystem services; Food webs; High arctic; Hot spot; Hunting grounds; Ice algae; International polar year; International researches; Killer whale; Pelagic-benthic coupling; Phytoplankton bloom; Primary production; Sea floor; Sea-ice cover; Secondary production; Biodiversity; Mammals; Phenols; Sea ice; Water recycling; Ecosystems; arctic environment; benthic-pelagic coupling; ecosystem service; food web; heterogeneity; hunting; ice cover; marine ecosystem; nutrient cycling; phenology; phytoplankton; primary production; research program; sea ice; species diversity; subarctic region; subspecies; whale; zooplankton; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Lancaster Sound; North Water Polynya; Nunavut; algae; Balaena mysticetus; Delphinapterus leucas; Mammalia; Monodon; Orcinus orca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867679158

They act as buffers of the land-sea interface, providing valuable ecosystem services such as nutrient recycling, decomposition of organic matter and removal of pollutants. Lagoons are regions of restricted exchange, subject to anthropogenic pressures that result in problems such as eutrophication. Because they are shallow, submerged primary producers play a prominent role in lagoon system metabolism. Furthermore, coastal lagoons are particularly vulnerable to global climate change and may act as 'sentinel systems'. Sea level rise already threatens to overwhelm some lagoons, such as Venice and Moroccan lagoons. Recent observations and studies have shown that a global climate change, especially the warming of the climate system and the sea level rise is unequivocal (IPCC, 2007). Therefore, the dCSTT-MPB model, which deals with nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations in the water column and within the sediments, was used to explore a range of scenarios that aimed at representing these changes. The tendency of the light limitation due to the sea level rise is the potential degradation of the microphytobenthos community. This reduction would lead to stronger nitrogen fluxes from pore water to the water column, increasing significantly the nitrogen concentrations. No increase in the phytoplankton community was found because it is mainly influenced by the resuspension of microphytobenthos. High nitrogen concentration may be the first indication of an eutrophication event. Nonetheless, nitrogen may be exported to the sea and cause problems in the adjacent coastal waters. The increase in temperature did not lead to significant differences. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; DCSTT-MPB model; Eutrophication; Microphytobenthos; Ria Formosa; Shallow coastal lagoons","anthropogenic effect; chlorophyll; climate change; coastal lagoon; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; environmental degradation; eutrophication; nitrogen; numerical model; nutrient cycling; pollutant removal; primary production; sea level change; shallow water; vulnerability; water column; Italy; Morocco; Veneto; Venezia [Veneto]; Venice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866922289

Jatropha accumulated and added to soil significant amounts of C (305kgha -1year -1) from the year one itself. Overall, a 3-5-year old plantation added per year around 4000kg plant biomass equivalent to 1450kgCha -1 - 800kg C through leaves, 150kg C through pruned twigs, and 495kg C as deoiled Jatropha cake. Biodiesel C replacement in the fossil fuel was 230kgha -1. Besides adding biomass to the soil, and C replacement in fossil fuel; the standing Jatropha rendered ecosystem service by fixing 5100-6100kgha -1C as the aboveground plus belowground biomass. Carbon additions by Jatropha during 4 years increased C content in the degraded surface soil layer by 19%, resulting in about 2500kgha -1C sequestered. Huge C additions and live root activity under Jatropha increased microbial population, respiration rate and microbial biomass C and N in soil. Along with C additions, 4000kgha -1year -1 plant biomass recycled into the soil 85.5kg nitrogen, 7.67kg phosphorus, 43.9kg potassium, 5.20kg sulphur, 0.11kg boron, 0.12kg zinc and other nutrients. The C additions improved water holding capacity of the soil under Jatropha as compared with the adjacent control soil which increased by 35% at 30kPa and 21% at 1500kPa soil water potential. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuel; Carbon sequestration; Degraded lands; Jatropha; Land rehabilitation; Nutrient recycling","bioaccumulation; biofuel; biomass; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; evergreen tree; fossil fuel; land degradation; land management; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; plantation; population structure; potassium; soil property; soil type; Jatropha; Jatropha curcas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865051259

In Cân Tho', rice-fish farmers had significantly higher income (43.6 million dong ha -1 year -1) than other farmer groups, while this was not seen among rice-fish famers in Tiên Giang (32.4 million dong ha -1 year -1), which partly could be due to a high use of insecticides (0.9 kg active ingredient ha -1 crop -1) and comparatively low fish yield among these farmers. The study emphasizes the need to rethink current agricultural systems and to provide opportunities for more diverse systems that maintain and enhance a range of ecosystem services and protect human health.

Nutrient use inefficiencies can cause environmental pollution through the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and of soluble and particulate forms of N, P and carbon (C) in leachate and run-off into watercourses. Improving nutrient use efficiencies in agriculture calls for the development of sustainable nutrient management strategies: more efficient use of mineral fertilisers, increased recovery and recycling of waste nutrients, and, better exploitation of the substantial inorganic and organic reserves of nutrients in the soil. Long-term field experimentation in the UK has provided key knowledge of the main nutrient transformations in agricultural soils. Emerging analytical technologies, especially stable isotope labelling, that better characterise macronutrient forms and bioavailability and improve the quantification of the complex relationships between the macronutrients in soils at the molecular scale, are augmenting this knowledge by revealing the underlying processes. The challenge for the future is to determine the relationships between the dynamics of N, P and C across scales, which will require both new modelling approaches and integrated approaches to macronutrient cycling. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Carbon; Macronutrients; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Soils","Agricultural productions; Agricultural soils; Agricultural system; Analytical technology; Complex relationships; Ecosystem services; Environmental pollutions; Field experimentation; Integrated approach; Leachates; Macronutrients; Molecular scale; Nutrient dynamics; Nutrient management; Nutrient-use efficiencies; Stable isotopes; Agriculture; Biochemistry; Carbon; Dynamics; Greenhouse gases; Isotopes; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Soils; Waste management; Nutrients; carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; agricultural production; agricultural soil; carbon; ecosystem service; farming system; greenhouse gas; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; nutrient dynamics; phosphorus; soil nutrient; sustainable development; agriculture; biogeochemical cycling; carbon cycling; crop protection; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; nitrogen cycling; nutrient cycle; phosphorus cycling; physical chemistry; priority journal; review; soil management; soil microflora; soil property; United Kingdom; Agriculture; Great Britain; Greenhouse Effect; United Kingdom",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865183663

Recent studies have evidenced that Technosols could support soil functions such as primary production but the knowledge about other ecosystemic services, such as nutrient cycling, is limited. We investigated how the total bacterial community and key functional microbial communities involved in nitrogen cycling were influenced by the depth and type of Technosol. We found that despite being artificially constructed, Technosols exhibited a gradual change in microbial activity and abundance along the soil profile. Both nitrification and denitrification rates decreased with increasing depth as previously observed in other soil systems. Potential denitrification and nitrification were correlated with Technosol physico-chemical properties but also with abundances of nirS denitrifiers and bacterial amoA gene, respectively. The correlation between nitrification rates and bacterial ammonia-oxidizers suggests that bacteria are driving nitrification in Technosols. A-RISA fingerprints showed a distinct community structure along different Technosol layers. Technosol properties affected denitrification strongly than nitrification underlining the importance of better understanding the microbial communities in Technosols to maximize their potential for nutrient cycling, an essential ecosystem function. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Ammonia-oxidation; Contaminated soils; Denitrification; Nitrification; Quantitative PCR; Soil depth","Ammonia-oxidation; Community structures; Contaminated soils; Denitrifiers; Ecosystem functions; Gradual changes; Microbial activities; Microbial communities; Nitrification and denitrification; Nitrification rates; Nitrogen cycling; Nutrient cycling; Physicochemical property; Potential denitrification; Primary production; Quantitative PCR; Soil depth; Soil function; Soil profiles; Soil systems; Total bacterial communities; Treated soils; Ammonia; Bacteria; Chemical properties; Genes; Industrial wastes; Nitrification; Nutrients; Oxidation; Polymerase chain reaction; Soil pollution; Soils; Denitrification; ammonia; chemical compound; DNA; nitrogen; technosol; unclassified drug; abundance; bacterium; denitrification; ecosystem service; industrial waste; land degradation; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrogen cycle; polymerase chain reaction; quantitative analysis; recycling; soil depth; soil profile; spatial distribution; article; bacterial gene; bacterium; biotechnology; controlled study; denitrification; ecosystem restoration; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrification; nitrogen cycling; nonhuman; physical chemistry; soil; soil degradation; soil pollution; Microbial Consortia; Nitrogen Cycle; Recycling; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864315281

Most assessments of global water resources have focused on surface water, but unsustainable depletion of groundwater has recently been documented on both regional and global scales. It remains unclear how the rate of global groundwater depletion compares to the rate of natural renewal and the supply needed to support ecosystems. Here we define the groundwater footprint (the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater-dependent ecosystem services) and show that humans are overexploiting groundwater in many large aquifers that are critical to agriculture, especially in Asia and North America. We estimate that the size of the global groundwater footprint is currently about 3.5 times the actual area of aquifers and that about 1.7 billion people live in areas where groundwater resources and/or groundwater-dependent ecosystems are under threat. That said, 80 per cent of aquifers have a groundwater footprint that is less than their area, meaning that the net global value is driven by a few heavily overexploited aquifers. The groundwater footprint is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the use, renewal and ecosystem requirements of groundwater at an aquifer scale. It can be combined with the water footprint and virtual water calculations, and be used to assess the potential for increasing agricultural yields with renewable groundwaterref. The method could be modified to evaluate other resources with renewal rates that are slow and spatially heterogeneous, such as fisheries, forestry or soil. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Significant differences in the C, N, P, K, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose contents and C/N and C/P ratios were recorded in different plant parts of water hyacinth and also between wetlands. The decomposition rates (k) were also significantly (P&lt;0.05) different between trophic conditions (F=702.16) and plant parts (F=1558.09). The decay constants revealed that the decomposition rates were faster in petioles (0.0252-0.0455kday -1), followed by the leaves (0.0176-0.0396kday -1) and the roots (0.0083-0.0130kday -1). Potassium mineralisation and turnover rates were higher than that of C, N and P. In general, the turnover rate was faster in the leaves and petioles of Eichhornia crassipes, which varied from 22 to about 57 days under different trophic conditions studied. Roots, however, decomposed slowly (77-121 days). The k values were strongly correlated with C, N, P, C/N and C/P. Overall, the higher turnover rate indicates that water hyacinth can accelerate the nutrient recycling potential in wetlands whereby the total ecosystem services could be judiciously regulated temporally.

Based on an overview of available research findings, we discuss three scientific hypotheses. First, the terrestrial ecosystem offers both positive and negative service functions. Second, changes in terrestrial ecosystem service functions lie not only in the number of ecosystem types and the coverage area of each type, but also in their quality. Third, the value of terrestrial ecosystem service functions should be assessed both in terms of the value stocked and the value added. We collected land use data from China during the period 1999-2008, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data based on remote sensing images from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies for the same period. We then calculated and analyzed spatial and temporal changes in China's terrestrial ecosystem service values over the 10-year period. Considering temporal change, the total value (stocked) of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions decreased from 6. 82 trillion Yuan RMB in 1999 to 6. 57 trillion Yuan RMB in 2008. During that period, the positive value decreased by 240. 17 billion Yuan RMB and the negative value increased by 8. 85 billion Yuan RMB. The decrease in total value lies mainly in the humidity control, soil formation, and waste recycling functions. The total value (added) of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions increased by 4. 31 billion Yuan RMB in 2000, but decreased by 0. 13 billion Yuan RMB in 2008 (based on the constant price of China in 1999). The value (added) was a negative figure. From the perspective of spatial change, we can see that the supply of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions fell slightly over the past 10 years, mainly in Northeast and Southern China. As a result of human activities on ecosystems, the loss of ecosystem service functions' value was relatively prominent in Shanxi and Gansu provinces, compared with an increase in value in Shaanxi Province. Terrestrial ecosystem service functions' value per unit area was relatively high in mid- and East China, showing a prominent spatial change over the 10-year period, but low in Western China. Some conclusions are drawn after an in-depth analysis of the factors causing the spatial and temporal changes in China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions, in the hope that our suggestions will be helpful for the management of China's terrestrial ecosystems. © 2012 The Author(s).","analysis of spatial and temporal change; China's terrestrial ecosystems; ecosystem service functions; positive and negative value accounting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862798149

The Indus Basin is shared by 4 countries-Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and China. With a current population of 237 million people which is projected to increase to 319 million in 2025 and 383 million in 2050, already today water resources are abstracted almost entirely (more than 95% for irrigation). Climate change will result in increased water availability in the short term. However in the long term water availability will decrease. Some current aspects in the basin need to be re-evaluated. During the past decades water abstractions-and especially groundwater extractions-have augmented continuously to support a rice-wheat system where rice is grown during the kharif (wet, summer) season (as well as sugar cane, cotton, maize and other crops) and wheat during the rabi (dry, winter) season. However, the sustainability of this system in its current form is questionable. Additional water for domestic and industrial purposes is required for the future and should be made available by a reduction in irrigation requirements. This paper gives a comprehensive listing and description of available options for current and future sustainable water resources management (WRM) within the basin. Sustainable WRM practices include both water supply management and water demand management options. Water supply management options include: (1) reservoir management as the basin is characterised by a strong seasonal behaviour in water availability (monsoon and meltwater) and water demands; (2) water quality conservation and investment in wastewater infrastructure; (3) the use of alternative water resources like the recycling of wastewater and desalination; (4) land use planning and soil conservation as well as flood management, with a focus on the reduction of erosion and resulting sedimentation as well as the restoration of ecosystem services like wetlands and natural floodplains.

A second group of authors argue the opposite: planting additional forests should raise downstream water availability and intensify the hydrologic cycle. Obtaining supporting evidence for this second group of authors has been more difficult due to the larger scales at which the positive effects of forests on the water cycle may be seen. We argue that forest cover is inextricably linked to precipitation. Forest-driven evapotranspiration removed from a particular catchment contributes to the availability of atmospheric moisture vapor and its cross-continental transport, raising the likelihood of precipitation events and increasing water yield, in particular in continental interiors more distant from oceans. Seasonal relationships heighten the importance of this phenomenon. We review the arguments from different scales and perspectives. This clarifies the generally beneficial relationship between forest cover and the intensity of the hydrologic cycle. While evidence supports both sides of the argument - trees can reduce runoff at the small catchment scale - at larger scales, trees are more clearly linked to increased precipitation and water availability. Progressive deforestation, land conversion from forest to agriculture and urbanization have potentially negative consequences for global precipitation, prompting us to think of forest ecosystems as global public goods. Policy-making attempts to measure product water footprints, estimate the value of ecosystem services, promote afforestation, develop drought mitigation strategies and otherwise manage land use must consider the linkage of forests to the supply of precipitation. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Afforestation; Climate change adaptation; Forest ecosystem services; Precipitation recycling; Water yield","afforestation; atmospheric moisture; climate change; demand-side management; ecosystem service; evapotranspiration; forest cover; forest ecosystem; precipitation assessment; reforestation; strategic approach; water availability; water yield",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857141053

Until now we have mainly focused on the biological aspects of dead wood and have only to a limited extent considered wider topics such as ecosystem functions, the future of forest biodiversity, and the need to disseminate information about the fascinating life in decaying wood. Value of saproxylic diversity We are convinced that the intrinsic value of the saproxylic species is a sufficient motivation for their protection. We can be fascinated by the peculiarity, strangeness and beauty of saproxylic species, and learn tremendously from the intricate interactions between them. But species living in dead wood are also more directly valuable, by providing products, ecological services and option values. Ecological functions, services and resilience The species that colonize and utilize dead trees provide a central ecosystem service, namely the decay of organic matter and the connected recycling of energy and nutrients. The decomposer community, mainly fungi but assisted by a multitude of invertebrates, performs this service at no cost, allowing the other living components of forest ecosystems to thrive. There is a growing awareness that the global loss of species threatens the provision of services such as decay and nutrient turnover. One might ask if the overwhelming variety of species living in wood is really necessary from this perspective. Maybe it would be enough that a few key species are present and that the vast majority of species are actually redundant. In any specific case there is probably no clear and simple answer, but a growing body of evidence suggests that a critical feature in ecosystems is the level of resilience (see, e.g., Rockstr ö m et al., 2009). It is highly unlikely that the exact number of ‘necessary’ species could be dei ned despite the fact that several species may perform the same function, rather than all of them having critical and unique functions. © J.

Estimating the role of earthworms in food webs is essential for a thorough evaluation of the ecosystem services they provide. Although their soft bodies are rapidly digested, earthworm remains can be detected via their chaetae in the faeces of predators.This study proposes a method for the identification of predated earthworm species using only predator faeces. We conducted morphological and molecular analyses of earthworm remains in the faeces of a highly endangered carnivorous land snail (Powelliphanta augusta) endemic to a restricted area of New Zealand.Microscopic examination of faecal strings from P. augusta showed the presence of earthworm chaetae in 47 of the 49 strings examined, suggesting an important role for earthworms in snail diets. Although earthworm tissue was not detectable in snail faeces, earthworm DNA was still present in sufficient quantity for molecular identification. Results showed that this land snail feeds on at least five species of New Zealand endemic earthworms.The method developed here is particularly appropriate for investigating the diet of potential invertebrate and vertebrate predators for which feeding behaviour is difficult to observe and gut content analysis is not possible. Such studies can help to develop a more complete understanding of the ecosystem services provided by earthworm communities. In this case it also helps the conservation of a rare and endangered predatory snail species. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.","Earthworms; Faecal analysis; Molecular diet analysis; New Zealand; Powelliphanta; Predatory snail","carnivory; diet; earthworm; ecosystem service; endangered species; endemic species; feces; food web; functional morphology; identification method; microscopy; molecular analysis; predator-prey interaction; snail; soil fertility; soil microorganism; terrestrial environment; New Zealand; Gastropoda; Invertebrata; Stylommatophora; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855339912

The ecosystem service values of crop production and atmospheric regulation between conventional cropping and fungus waste recycling had no significant difference. The ecosystem service value of environmental purification under fungus waste recycling was twice of the straw directly recycling; conventional cropping was the lowest. Compared to conventional cropping, the values for maintaining soil fertility under straw directly recycling and fungus waste recycling increased by 22.30% and 37.16%, respectively. It is worth mentioning that, the values for greenhouse gas emissions from the fungus waste recycling, which compared to conventional cropping and straw directly recycling, were decreased by 25.46% and 32.48%, respectively.

EWD was defined as the volume of water in natural ecosystem used by human beings, and this indicator could be applied to study the relationship between ecological water-use and human water use. EWD includes internal-EWD and external-EWD, which was classified by the studied scales. If EWD was classified by style, it includes resource-based one and quality-based one. The model for EWD drivers' analysis was applied to calculate the contribution ratio of different factors such as consumption per capita, industry value added, agriculture value added and so on, and determine the key driver factor. Moreover, grey relational analysis (GRA) was applied to estimate the relationship between EWD and ecological factor of water (EFW). EWD concepts and calculating methods were applied to the case of Beijing City. Main results were: 1) from 1999 to 2009, resource-based EWD declined from 25.56×10 8 m 3 to 15.65×10 8 m 3 and quality-based EWD declined from 12.55× 10 8 m 3 to 4. 58×10 8 m 3. The ratio of total ecological water depletion (R ewd) was over 55% in 2009, which had been even higher than 80% during 2003-2005. Comparing resource-based and quality-based EWD, the former was more important. Through analyzing drivers of EWD, it is found that the level of consumption per capita was the most important driver factor for EWD increasing and industrial added value was the second. There are some changes of EFW in Beijing City caused by EWD including: 1) Groundwater. Compared with 1960s, the groundwater storage of Beijing decreased by more than 100× 10 8 m 3 in 2009; 2) Wetlands. The area of wetlands in Beijing was 2461 km 2 one hundred years ago, but nowadays only remained 514km 2 in 2007; 3) Water quality. More than 40% rivers could not reaching the national water environmental quality standards; 4) Biodiversity. Wetlands birds are now only 152 species comparing with more than 300 species in historical records; 5) Safety. The area of land subsidence caused by groundwater overdraft had reached 4114km 2 in 2005. It has been found that in Beijing the factors of surface water use and sewage treatment rate have strong correlation to water habitats with correlation degree (r) 0.642 and 0.600 respectively; the factors of water withdrawal and groundwater use are strongly related to water environment with r 0.839 and 0.821 respectively; the depth of groundwater and population have strong correlation to water disaster with r 0.887 and 0.733 respectively. To enhance the ecological services of water, the rate of ecological water depletion (R ewd) accounting should be reduced to 30% by means of strictly controlling the withdrawal of surface and groundwater, increasing the sewage treatment rate, recharging groundwater and strictly controlling population growth as well. It is necessary to adjust the industrial structure, enhance the efficiency of industrial water use, increase the rate of industrial water recycling, and improve the efficiency of farming irrigation water use to reduce the EWD by human use in Beijing effectively. People's behavior and consciousness on water consumption were very important for constructing the water saving society.","Beijing; Correlation; Drivers; Ecological water depletion","bird; consumption behavior; ecological approach; ecosystem service; groundwater resource; historical record; human activity; industrial structure; nature-society relations; numerical model; population growth; river water; sewage treatment; surface water; water availability; water quality; water storage; water use; wetland; Beijing [China]; China; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052169616

Anthropogenic pollutants, whether from the industrial era or as a result of our contemporary lifestyles, can negatively affect these functions with hitherto unknown consequences on ecology, the economy and human health. Thus far, the singular view of the involved disciplines such as ecotoxicology, environmental microbiology, hydrology and geomorphology has prevented a deeper understanding of this emerging issue. Main features This paper discusses briefly the progressions and the state-of-the-art methods within the disciplines of concern related to contaminated sediments, ranging from ecotoxicological test systems, microbiological/molecular approaches to unravel changes of microbial ecosystems, up to the modelling of sediment transport and sorption/desorption of associated pollutants. The first bilateral research efforts on contaminated sediments include efforts to assess ecotoxicological sediment risk including sediment mobility (i.e. ecotoxicology and engineering), enhance bioremediation potential (i.e. microbiology and ecotoxicology) or to understand biostabilisation processes of sediments by microbial assemblages (i.e. microbiology and engineering). Conclusions and perspectives In freshwater habitats, acute, chronic and mechanism-specific toxic effects on organisms, shifts in composition, structure and functionality of benthic microbial communities, as well as the obstruction of important ecosystem services by continuously discharged and long-deposited pollutants, should be related to the in situ sediment dynamics. To achieve an improved understanding of the ecology of freshwater sediments and the impairment of their important ecosystem functions by human-derived pollutants, we suggest a ""triad plus x"" approach combining advanced methods of ecotoxicology, environmental microbiology and engineering science. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Biofilm; Freshwater; Interdisciplinary approach; Management of sediments; Pollutants; Risk assessment","anthropogenic source; biofilm; bioremediation; desorption; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; ecotoxicology; freshwater sediment; interdisciplinary approach; lifestyle; microbial community; public health; risk assessment; sediment pollution; sediment transport; sorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860388864

In particular, both the extent to which declines in coral cover lead to declines in complexity and the length of time it takes for reefs to collapse following coral mortality are unknown. Here we assess the extent of temporal and spatial covariation between coral cover and reef architectural complexity using a Caribbean-wide dataset of temporally replicated estimates spanning four decades. Both coral cover and architectural complexity have declined rapidly over time, with little evidence of a time-lag. However, annual rates of change in coral cover and complexity do not covary, and levels of complexity vary greatly among reefs with similar coral cover. These findings suggest that the stressors influencing Caribbean reefs are sufficiently severe and widespread to produce similar regional-scale declines in coral cover and reef complexity, even though reef architectural complexity is not a direct function of coral cover at local scales. Given that architectural complexity is not a simple function of coral cover, it is important that conservation monitoring and restoration give due consideration to both architecture and coral cover. This will help ensure that the ecosystem services supported by architectural complexity, such as nutrient recycling, dissipation of wave energy, fish production and diversity, are maintained and enhanced. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Ecosystem services; Foundation species; Habitat loss; Reef degradation","conservation management; coral reef; data set; ecosystem service; environmental restoration; habitat loss; marine ecosystem; mortality; reef formation; restoration ecology; spatial variation; temporal variation; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Sea; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957835614

Extensive spraying of insecticides presents a hazard to these insects. Using a control-treatment paired design comprising 3 replicate pairs of plots per soil type, we quantified the impact of fipronil on termite consumption of cardboard and wood baits, termite repair of deliberately damaged mounds as well as ant community composition and abundance in two different habitats (black vertisol and red kandosol soil) when applied aerially at a dose rate recommended for locust control in Australia. The study was conducted from 2006 to 2008. The diversity of termites and ants was higher and side-effects were more pronounced on kandosol than on vertisol soil. Overall termite consumption of cardboard baits was significantly greater in unsprayed than in sprayed plots while losses were significantly greater in only one (vertisol) or two (kandosol) sprayed plots, respectively, compared to paired unsprayed plots. In the first year, termite consumption of wood baits was generally significantly greater on unsprayed than on sprayed kandosol while only marginally significant on unsprayed vertisol. Again, losses were significantly greater in one (vertisol) and two (kandosol) sprayed plots, respectively, compared to paired unsprayed plots. Overall termite consumption of wood baits was similar among plots in the second year post-spray although consumption remained significantly depressed in one pair of sprayed plots in each habitat. The capacity of the mound-building termite, Drepanotermes rubriceps (Froggatt) unique to kandosol, to repair damaged mounds was significantly reduced by fipronil. Furthermore, colonies of Iridomyrmex greensladei Shattuck, an ant species associated with mounds of D. rubriceps, were not re-located five months post-spray. Ant communities were also adversely affected. On vertisol, species richness and relative abundance were similar among treatments, but significantly fewer species were caught in one individual sprayed plot. In contrast on kandosol, species richness and relative abundance were significantly reduced by fipronil. A drop in species richness was observed in all and a drop in relative abundance in two sprayed plots. On vertisol, abundances of two species were significantly lower in sprayed than in paired unsprayed plots. Likewise on kandosol, abundances of five species were significantly reduced in sprayed plots, and one species was not caught at all. The weight of evidence of our findings indicate that fipronil, even at a low rate, will have substantial adverse impacts on the diversity and activity of termites and ants, especially if applied within one to two years of earlier applications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Detritivores; Ecosystem services; Epigaeal invertebrates; Granivores; Insecticidal impact; Non-target taxa; Nutrient recycling; Soil structure","ant; detritivory; ecosystem engineering; ecosystem service; fipronil; granivory; locust; nutrient cycling; pesticide application; pesticide resistance; relative abundance; soil structure; soil type; species diversity; species richness; termite; Vertisol; Australia; Drepanotermes rubriceps; Formicidae; Hexapoda; Invertebrata; Iridomyrmex greensladei; Isoptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955912356

As our numbers and appetites grow, food supplies become less secure, reserves of clean energy dwindle, pools of freshwater evaporate, the atmosphere's capacity to absorb our emissions diminishes and space for human and biotic habitat grows scarce. In response, some are now asking whether the biosphere can support our growing herds of domesticated livestock, notably ruminants. My aim in this review is to contemplate the place of these animals in a world in need of re-greening, in more ways than one. In addressing this objective, I advance the premise that the place of livestock is examined best from the vantage of 'land', broadly defined. Livestock have been implicated in many injurious processes: land use change, excess water use, nutrient excretion, fossil energy use, competition for food and emission of greenhouse gases. At the same time, they offer numerous benefits: producing food from human inedible sources, preserving ecosystem services, promoting perennials on croplands, recycling plant nutrients and providing social benefits. Thus livestock can be both stressors and benefactors to land and the aim of researchers should be to shift the net effect from stress to beneficence. To advance this goal, I offer seven questions, seen through the lenses of 'systems', 'place', 'time' and 'community', mostly to foster discourse. How do we better study whole systems? How do we better tune the systems to local land? How can we know long term consequences? How do we measure progress? How do we choose among trade-offs? How do we engage society? What will (or should) our successors' livestock systems look like? Humans and their livestock are intertwined to such an extent that their symbiosis will not likely soon be severed. Livestock offer many benefits to human society and often their place in ecosystems can be ecologically justified. But that does not mean that all ways of raising them are beneficial, nor that they necessarily fit everywhere. In coming decades, researchers, in concert with practitioners, consumers and policymakers, will need to show creativity, foresight and courage to envision new ways of melding animals into our ecosystems, not only to minimize harm, but to advance their re-greening.This paper is part of the special issue entitled: Greenhouse Gases in Animal Agriculture - Finding a Balance between Food and Emissions, Guest Edited by T.A.

Human activities have affected soil ecosystem functions and in many cases caused soil ecosystem collapse. This review provides a synthesis of current knowledge of human impacts on soil ecosystems, with a special focus on knowledge gaps regarding soil ecosystem shifts and tipping points, using the island of Crete, Greece as an example. Soil ecosystem shifts are abrupt changes that occur at "" tipping points"" and have long-lasting effects on the landscape and both the biotic and abiotic structure of the soil. These shifts can occur due to climate change, land use change, fertilization, or above-ground biodiversity decline. The environmental pressures in the agricultural land of Crete, place the island very close to tipping points, and make it an "" ideal"" area for soil ecosystem shifts. Reversing the trend of the shift while using the soil ecosystem services, means that significantly more organic matter needs to be added to the soil compared to the amount added under set-aside conditions. Potential nutrient supply and demand calculations indicate that fertilizer demand in Crete can be satisfied by recycling of bio-residue and livestock excreta produced on the island. Soil fertility improves faster if, in addition to bio-fertilization, farmers use traditional agricultural practices such as crop rotations and legume row plantings within olive trees and orchards. A renewed soil fertility paradigm shift requires a "" holistic"" management of biotic-soil-water resources in order to provide sufficient and an appropriate type of organic matter to the plant-microorganism system to maximize food production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Abrupt change; Agricultural land; Agricultural practices; Crop rotation; Ecosystem collapse; Ecosystem functions; Ecosystem services; Environmental pressures; Food production; Human activities; Human impact; Knowledge gaps; Land-use change; Long lasting; Nutrient supply; Organic matter; Paradigm shifts; Plantings; Soil fertility; Tipping point; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Climate change; Economics; Fertilizers; Land use; Landforms; Organic compounds; Plants (botany); Soils; Water resources; Ecosystems; agricultural practice; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; climate change; community structure; crop rotation; fertilizer application; food production; land use change; landscape; livestock; nutrient cycling; orchard; population decline; soil fertility; soil management; soil type; Crete; Greece; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955953867

Here we report the first set of host-affiliate species-discharge relationships (SDR) in freshwater and examine how anticipated shifts in water availability (flow) will impact coextirpations. We used SDR for freshwater mussels and fish across 11 regions (over 350 rivers) in the continental United States that we coupled to future water availability (2070) to model mussel and fish coextirpations. We also used river-specific host-affiliate matrices (presence-absence) to evaluate how host-specificity (mean number of hosts used by an affiliate) and host-overlap (extent to which affiliates share hosts) relate to extirpation vulnerability. We found that the strength and predictability of SDR models vary geographically and that mussels were more susceptible to flow alterations than fish. These patterns of extirpations were strongest in the southeast where: (1) flow reductions are expected to be greatest; (2) more species are lost per unit flow; (3) and more mussels are expected to be lost per unit of fish. We also found that overall mussel losses associated with reduction in habitat (water availability) were greater than those associated with loss of fish hosts which we assumed to be a function of host redundancy. These findings highlight the utility of SDR as a tool for conservation efforts but they also demonstrate the potential severity of reductions in mussel and fish richness as consequence of climate change and water use. Mussels provide key ecosystem services but face multiple pronged attacks from reductions in flow, habitat, and fish hosts. These losses in biodiversity and ecosystem functions can translate into major effects on food webs and nutrient recycling. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Discharge; Extirpation; Fish; Functional redundancy; Habitat modeling; Host-specificity; Mussel; Simulation","biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; discharge; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; fish; food web; habitat structure; host use; mollusc; nutrient cycling; water availability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952068995

Scleractinian corals function as the primary reef ecosystem engineers, constructing the framework that serves as a habitat for all other coral reef-associated organisms. However, the coral's engineering role is particularly susceptible to global climate change. Ocean warming can cause extensive mass coral bleaching, which triggers dysfunction of major engineering processes. Sub-lethal bleaching results in the reduction of both primary productivity and coral calcification. This may lead to changes in the release of organic and inorganic products, thereby altering critical biogeochemical and recycling processes in reef ecosystems. Thermal stress-induced bleaching and subsequent coral mortality, along with ocean acidification, further lead to long-term shifts in benthic community structure, changes in topographic reef complexity, and the modification of reef functioning. Such shifts may cause negative feedback loops and further modification of coral-derived inorganic and organic products. This review emphasises the critical role of scleractinian corals as reef ecosystem engineers and highlights the control of corals over key reef ecosystem goods and services, including high biodiversity, coastal protection, fishing, and tourism. Thus, climate change by impeding coral ecosystem engineers will impair the ecosystem functioning of entire reefs. © CSIRO 2011.","bleaching; ecosystem goods and services; ocean warming and acidification","acidification; benthos; biodiversity; calcification; climate change; coastal protection; coral reef; ecosystem engineering; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; habitat conservation; marine ecosystem; mortality; primary production; sublethal effect; Anthozoa; Scleractinia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952121247

As an example of recycling service, we focus on the consumption of livestock carcasses by obligate scavengers, taking the case of vultures which face a dramatic decline worldwide. We investigate whether maintaining this recycling service through individual feeding stations called light feeding stations in contrast to aggregated resource on heavy feeding stations can meet the double objectives of vulture conservation and service efficiency. We built a spatially explicit multi-agent model to investigate the long term effects of livestock farmers practices on both the recycling service efficiency for farmers and vulture population carrying capacity including: (i) carcass disposal practices that drive the quantity and spatial distribution of resources for vultures and (ii) temporal distribution of livestock mortality due to economic choices that drive the dynamics of resources for vultures. In addition, we examine various scenarios related to vulture feeding behaviour - i.e. central place vs. random foraging and contest vs. scramble intraspecific competition - that may play a role in the vulture carrying capacity and recycling service efficiency. When accounting for vulture central place foraging, we found that favouring the use of light feeding stations instead of heavy feeding station does not affect vulture population carrying capacity and increases the number of farmer for which vulture service is optimal. The increase of light feeding station users poorly affects the number of farmers for which vulture service is optimal in contrast to results obtained with a vulture random foraging behaviour. Both of the recycling service efficiency and the vulture carrying capacity vary with the kind of intraspecific competition and with the seasonal distribution of livestock mortality. Livestock mortality distributions with a seasonal peak of mortality result in a mismatch between vulture food requirement and farmers needs for carcass removal. Finally we raise several points on the relevance of light feeding stations as a sustainable management for vulture conservation and for the recycling service and discuss the potential implications of seasonal scarcity of resources due to farming economic constraints. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Carrying capacity; Conservation; Ecosystem service; Farming practices; Feeding stations management; Multi-agent system; Resource distribution; Scavengers; Vulture","Carrying capacity; Ecosystem service; Farming practices; Resource distribution; Scavengers; Vulture; Competition; Feeding; Forestry; Multi agent systems; Natural resources management; Optimization; Population statistics; Recycling; Ecosystems; conservation management; ecological modeling; ecosystem service; farming system; livestock; mortality; numerical model; population decline; raptor; recycling; resource availability; scavenging (feeding); species conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651461988

Starting from September-October, leaves and part of rhizomes detach off the marine plant and reach the beaches. Onshore residues represent a great environmental, economical, social and hygienic problem in all coastal zones of Mediterranean Basin because of the great disturb to the bathers and population, and the high costs for their removal and disposal to landfill. Authors characterized the onshore residues by means of physical, chemical and spectroscopic analyses in order to propose alternative solutions to the landfill and to reutilize them in agricultural applications as well as a source of energy. Physical, chemical and spectroscopic features of posidonia residues indicated a possible utilization in agriculture in their raw state.

AL5 2JQ, United Kingdom","Requirements for research, practices and policies affecting soil management in relation to global food security are reviewed. Managing soil organic carbon (C) is central because soil organic matter influences numerous soil properties relevant to ecosystem functioning and crop growth. Even small changes in total C content can have disproportionately large impacts on key soil physical properties. Practices to encourage maintenance of soil C are important for ensuring sustainability of all soil functions. Soil is a major store of C within the biosphere - increases or decreases in this large stock can either mitigate or worsen climate change. Deforestation, conversion of grasslands to arable cropping and drainage of wetlands all cause emission of C; policies and international action to minimise these changes are urgently required. Sequestration of C in soil can contribute to climate change mitigation but the real impact of different options is often misunderstood. Some changes in management that are beneficial for soil C, increase emissions of nitrous oxide (a powerful greenhouse gas) thus cancelling the benefit. Research on soil physical processes and their interactions with roots can lead to improved and novel practices to improve crop access to water and nutrients. Increased understanding of root function has implications for selection and breeding of crops to maximise capture of water and nutrients. Roots are also a means of delivering natural plant-produced chemicals into soil with potentially beneficial impacts. These include biocontrol of soil-borne pests and diseases and inhibition of the nitrification process in soil (conversion of ammonium to nitrate) with possible benefits for improved nitrogen use efficiency and decreased nitrous oxide emission. The application of molecular methods to studies of soil organisms, and their interactions with roots, is providing new understanding of soil ecology and the basis for novel practical applications. Policy makers and those concerned with development of management approaches need to keep a watching brief on emerging possibilities from this fast-moving area of science. Nutrient management is a key challenge for global food production: there is an urgent need to increase nutrient availability to crops grown by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Many changes in practices including inter-cropping, inclusion of nitrogen-fixing crops, agroforestry and improved recycling have been clearly demonstrated to be beneficial: facilitating policies and practical strategies are needed to make these widely available, taking account of local economic and social conditions. In the longer term fertilizers will be essential for food security: policies and actions are needed to make these available and affordable to small farmers. In developed regions, and those developing rapidly such as China, strategies and policies to manage more precisely the necessarily large flows of nutrients in ways that minimise environmental damage are essential. A specific issue is to minimise emissions of nitrous oxide whilst ensuring sufficient nitrogen is available for adequate food production. Application of known strategies (through either regulation or education), technological developments, and continued research to improve understanding of basic processes will all play a part. Decreasing soil erosion is essential, both to maintain the soil resource and to minimise downstream damage such as sedimentation of rivers with adverse impacts on fisheries. Practical strategies are well known but often have financial implications for farmers. Examples of systems for paying one group of land users for ecosystem services affecting others exist in several parts of the world and serve as a model. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Aggregates; Biochar; Biodiversity; Carbon; Erosion; Minimum tillage; Nitrogen; Nitrous oxide; Nutrients; Organic matter; Phosphorous; Rhizosphere; Roots; Sequestration; Soil; Soil organisms; Soil structure","aggregate; agroforestry; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; deforestation; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; emission control; food production; food security; intercropping; nitrification; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient enrichment; organic carbon; phosphorus; recycling; rhizosphere; root; sedimentation; soil erosion; soil management; soil organic matter; soil property; soil structure; sustainability; tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751698739

Research is needed on how to balance the competition from shade trees with the provision of ecological services to the coffee. In 2000, long-term coffee experiments were established in Costa Rica and Nicaragua to compare coffee agroecosystem performance under full sun, legume and non-legume shade types, and intensive and moderate conventional and organic inputs. Coffee yield from intensive organic production was not significantly different from intensive conventional in Nicaragua, but in Costa Rica it was lower during three of the six harvests. Full sun coffee production over 6 years was greater than shaded coffee in Costa Rica (61.8 vs. 44.7 t ha-1, P = 0.0002). In Nicaragua, full sun coffee production over 5 years (32.1 t ha-1) was equal to coffee with shade that included Tabebuia rosea (Bertol.) DC., (27-30 t ha-1) and both were more productive (P = 0.03) than coffee shaded with Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd. (21.6 t ha-1). Moderate input organic production was significantly lower than other managements under all shade types, except in the presence of Erythrina poepiggina (Walp.) O. F. Cook. Inga and Erythrina had greater basal area and nutrient recycling from prunings than other shade species. Intensive organic production increased soil pH and P, and had higher K compared to moderate conventional. Although legume shade trees potentially provide ecological services to associated coffee, this depends on management of the competition from those same trees. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Ecological services; Erythrina poepiggiana; Inga laurina; Nitrogen mineralization; Nutrient balance; Nutrient recycling; Sustainable coffee production; Tabebuia rosea; Terminalia amazonia","agricultural ecosystem; agrochemical; coffee; crop yield; ecosystem service; experimental study; legume; mineralization; organic farming; shading; sustainability; sustainable development; Central America; Inga; Inga laurina; Tabebuia; Tabebuia rosea; Terminalia; Terminalia amazonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027949703

However, lack of market experience may cause respondents in valuation surveys to be more prone to interview effects than they would be with other opinion surveys. Without reference to market price or experience, respondents are less likely to have well-defined preferences, which may cause respondents to be more easily influenced by the interview process and characteristics of the interviewer. In this paper, we investigate interview effects in a random digit dial telephone survey of recycling valuation and behavior. Following previous research in both psychology and survey methodology, we test the direct effects of interviewer gender and race, as well as the interaction effects between interviewer and respondent characteristics. Using data from 130 interviewers and 1,786 interviewees, we apply a hierarchical regression model that accounts for the clustering of interviews and controls for a variety of other confounding variables. We confirm the existence of both direct and conditional interviewer effects. Respondents state higher willingness to pay when interviewed by white or female interviewers than by non-white or male interviewers. There were also significant interaction effects between interviewer and respondent characteristics. The directions of the interviewer effects are consistent with previous survey research and social psychology theories. We also identify some non-traditional interview process factors that have an influence on survey responses. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Interview effects; Recycling; Social attribution model; Willingness to pay","Commerce; Economics; Recycling; Regression analysis; Telephone sets; Environmental services; Environmental valuation; Hierarchical regression models; Interaction effect; Interview effects; Social psychology; Survey methodology; Willingness to pay; Surveys; ecosystem service; environmental economics; numerical model; psychology; questionnaire survey; recycling; regression analysis; telephone network; valuation; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955854995

This chapter is a synthesis of the regional implications of producing four genera of short rotation energy crops as feedstocks for fuels, chemicals, and fibers set in the rich history of research and development of these purpose-grown trees in the United States. The four genera include: Populus (cottonwoods, poplars, aspens), Salix (willows), Pinus (southern pines), and Eucalyptus (eucalypts). Key aspects of the production systems are discussed, including tree biology, genetics and tree improvement, and silvicultural management. The availability of short rotation woody biomass is evaluated on the basis of maintaining sustainability at multiple scales. Current efforts to maximize production are described. Overall, sustainable production of fuels, chemicals, and fibers from woody biomass depends on a combination of feedstocks from both forests and plantations; the importance of dedicated SRWC feedstock production systems is highlighted. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","Cottonwood; Ecosystem services; Energy security; Eucalypts; Hybrid aspen; Intensive forestry; Poplar; Southern pine; Sustainability; Willow; Woody feedstocks","Biomass; Chemicals; Crops; Energy policy; Energy security; Feedstocks; Fuels; Soil conservation; Sustainable development; Cottonwood; Ecosystem services; Eucalypts; Hybrid aspen; Intensive forestry; Poplar; Southern pines; Willow; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905514410

Since buildings are required to fulfil our primary need for shelter, consumption of these resources is simply unavoidable. However, with shrinking stock of natural resources and degrading eco-system services, the consumption process has to be wise, judicious and non-wasteful. Search for alternative and recycled materials, multiple floor spaces and use of renewable energy are some of the human responses against the perceived threat of materials, land and energy constraints respectively. Water resource management in building construction and operation, however, has still a long way to go, especially because the amount of water used per unit area of construction largely remains undocumented. There has been some pioneering research on embodied water measurement of several non-residential buildings in Australia. In this backdrop, the present paper seeks to understand and assess the quantity of fresh water used in contemporary urban multi-storeyed residential buildings and reports a study conducted for a real-life project in Calcutta (now, Kolkata), India. Since the use of construction water directly varies with the type of construction, a steel and glass building will have its embodied water-footprint mainly on account of that of its materials while on-site water use plays a major role in case of a cast-in-situ reinforced cement concrete and brick building. Thus, water efficiency at the production stage is required in the first case while the second category demands concerns and actions at the consumption stage. This paper examines some of the issues related to the subject like water demand at material production as well as construction stage and the resultant embodied water of typical urban constructions in India, which was found to be in the range of about 27 Kilolitres/Sq m of total built-up area. © 2011 WIT Press.","Construction water; Ground water; Site water management","building construction; ecosystem service; renewable resource; resource management; water resource; water use efficiency; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84555207838

There are those who see limits approaching for fossil fuel use and minerals availability, as well as for ecosystem services such as fresh water and pollution absorption capacity provided at no cost by nature. This view was most famously put forward in the 1972 book 'Limits to Growth' by Donella Meadows and colleagues, but there are many more recent exponents of this view. Already, we may have exceeded safe limits for greenhouse gas emissions, loss of biodiversity, and disturbance of the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, and may be approaching safe limits for a number of other environmental problems. A competing view is that limits to provision of fuels, minerals, etc can be circumvented by technological ingenuity. Non-conventional fossil fuels can replace depleted conventional fossil fuels if the need arises; mining progressively lower-grade ores, together with substitution and recycling of used products can solve possible raw material shortages; and new non-carbon energy sources, carbon capture and sequestration, and ultimately geoengineering, can mitigate any effects of global climate change. In this chapter we present material which can help resolve this dispute. We use the 'Earth Systems Science' approach discussed in Chapter 1. An underlying assumption of much human activity is that resources are either effectively unlimited, or that substitutes are readily available. We stress the energy costs of both energy and mineral extraction, and the interactions that can occur, for example, between the biosphere and the climate system. Also, all resources occur in individual nation states; these countries will not necessarily want to export increasingly scarce resources. Declining availability will place further difficulties in the path of continued growth in economic output, and, increase the likelihood of conflict over vital resources. This declining availability of useable resources, will also impact on our ability to provide food and fresh water to a growing human population. Increasingly in the future, if we continue in a 'business-as-usual' manner, we will face multiple interacting crises. Rising populations will need more food and forage for domestic animals at the same time as farmland and fresh water are lost to cities. In many low-income countries, output per hectare is already falling because of soil erosion. On-going climate change will further tend to lower agricultural output, because of high temperatures during the growing season, and probable rises in the frequency of pest outbreaks.",,"Agricultural robots; Animals; Biodiversity; Carbon capture; Climate change; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Minerals; Raw materials; Water; Water absorption; Water pollution; Absorption capacity; Agricultural output; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Earth systems science; Environmental problems; Global climate changes; Low income countries; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883614373

Five parts of ecosystem services (ES) were included, and they were producing organic matter, atmospheric gas regulation, recycling nutrient matter, holding water resources and conserving soil and water. The universal soil loss equation (USLE) was applied for estimating the service value of conserving soil and water which expected to improve the effect of assessment. From the results, the overall value in the entire region was 1636.81 × 108 RMB, with unbalanced constitution of 5 parts. A clear seasonal division was shown in the overall value and most parts. The distribution pattern in latitude, longitude, altitude was revealed respectively. Most parts of ecosystem services performed consistently response to both seasonal and spatial variation, except for the service of holding water resources and conserving soil and water. The major characteristics of ESV distribution can be roughly explained by the distribution and variation pattern of NPP and other crucial meteorological elements. The assessment of ESV by integrating multi-sourced data can provide an relatively objective result and have some indications for natural resources management.

Using field measurements and population data, we find that marine mammals can enhance primary productivity in their feeding areas by concentrating nitrogen near the surface through the release of flocculent fecal plumes. Whales and seals may be responsible for replenishing 2.3x104 metric tons of N per year in the Gulf of Maine's euphotic zone, more than the input of all rivers combined. This upward ''whale pump'' played a much larger role before commercial harvest, when marine mammal recycling of nitrogen was likely more than three times atmospheric N input.

Across a landscape, vegetation can be maintained or restored or modified or removed and replaced to meet the changing needs of society, giving mosaics of vegetation types and 'condition classes' that can range from intact native ecosystems to highly modified systems. These various classes will produce different levels and types of ecosystem services and the challenge for natural resource management programs and land management decisions is to be able to consider the complex nature of trade-offs between a wide range of ecosystem services. We use vegetation types and their condition classes as a first approximation or surrogate to define and map the underlying ecosystems in terms of their regulating, supporting, provisioning and cultural services. In using vegetation as a surrogate, we believe it is important to describe natural or modified (e.g. agronomic) vegetation classes in terms of structure - which in turn is related to ecosystem function (rooting depth, nutrient recycling, carbon capture, water use, etc.). This approach enables changes in vegetation as a result of land use to be coupled with changes to surface and groundwater resources and other physical and chemical properties of soils.For Australian ecosystems an existing structural classification based on height and cover of all vegetation layers is suggested as the appropriate functional vegetation classification. This classification can be used with a framework for mapping and manipulating vegetation condition classes. These classes are based on the degree of modification to pre-existing vegetation and, in the case of biodiversity, this is the original vegetation. A landscape approach enables a user to visualise and evaluate the trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives at a spatial scale at which the delivery of ecosystem services can meaningfully be influenced and reported. Such trade-offs can be defined using a simple scoring system or, if the ecological and socio-economic data exist in sufficient detail, using process-based models.Existing Australian databases contain information that can be aggregated at the landscape and water catchment scales. The available spatial information includes socio-economic data, terrain, vegetation type and cover, soils and their hydrological properties, groundwater quantity and surface water flows. Our approach supports use of this information to design vegetation management interventions for delivery of an appropriate mix of ecosystem services across landscapes with diverse land uses. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem function; Ecosystem services; Landscape; Multiple benefits; Structural classification; Trade-offs; Vegetation condition; Vegetation management; Vegetation type",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955346389

For that reason, restoration after such extractive industries' work is common and has been well studied. However, many ecological restoration schemes do not examine to what extent complete and functioning ecosystems have been restored above and below ground. While the aim should be to restore functioning ecosystems, most restoration plans focus only on vegetation and above ground macro-fauna. Among the potential species that are likely to be important early in mine land restoration, earthworms are particularly good candidates. They provide several ecosystem services that are likely to accelerate soil restoration, improve primary production and facilitate the restoration of a functional ecosystem in mining areas. These services include the following: increase in topsoil fertility, food for a wide range of predators and recycling of waste organic materials on rehabilitated areas. Here, we outline some of the challenges specifically facing opencast mining restoration and describe how the ecosystem services provided by earthworms may address some of these challenges. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Earthworm introduction; Ecological restoration; Functioning ecological ecosystems; Soil rehabilitation; Waste bio-stabilisation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953286454

The ecosystem services have become less effective because the production of water and CO2 are faster than recycling it in biomass. The produced water with CO2, during the oxidation of organic carbon thanks to the chemical reduction of oxygen, is often neglected and not mentioned by the scientific community. The water volume that results from the burning of fossil fuels increases annually with CO2 emissions and is higher than thousands of billions of tons. This water increase affects water vapour levels and induces the risk of great floods and sea level rising. We suggest an ecolonomical (ecology and economy) integrative concept based on the use of oxygen, as a regulator, which links the burning of fuels that generate water and fossil CO2 to photosynthesis that regenerates oxygen and biomass essential for our life. The ecolonomical quantitative rule claims that the oxygen users such as transportation services, manufacturers and power plants must pay those who produce it such as forest, agriculture and urban vegetation. The application of this rule should induce the restoring of natural ecosystems and agricultural practices thanks to the link between the urban services and the rural services. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Burning; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Fossil carbon; Oxygen; Vapour water",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956423648

We studied the impact of various approaches to manage a red fescue cover crop in a winter wheat crop in terms of light, water and nitrogen competition, using the STICS crop model adapted for intercropping. The STICS model for wheat/fescue intercropping was first evaluated on two years of experimental data obtained in the field. It gave satisfactory statistical results for the prediction of dry matter, leaf area index (LAI) and nitrogen accumulation in the two species, and for nitrogen and water dynamics in the soil. By simulating unmeasured variables, such as transpiration, the model improves our understanding of the performance of the intercrop in the field. For example, we showed that the intercropping system was more efficient that wheat grown as a sole crop, in terms of nitrogen accumulation and decreasing soil nitrogen levels before the leaching period. However, it also resulted in lower wheat yields. We then used the STICS model to compare four intercropping management scenarios differing in terms of the date of red fescue emergence, over 35 climatic years. We found that, in most climatic scenarios, the emergence of the fescue crop during the late tillering phase of the wheat crop gave the best compromise between wheat yield overall nitrogen accumulation and radiation interception. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These services include, for example, nutrient reduction that leads to water quality improvements in some wetlands and climatic regulation through recycling of precipitation in rain forests. While agriculture has increased 'provisioning' ecosystem services, such as food, fiber and timber production, it has, through time, substantially impacted other ecosystem services. Here we review the trade-offs among ecosystem services that have been generated by agriculture-induced changes to water quality and quantity in downstream aquatic systems, wetlands and terrestrial systems. We highlight emerging issues that need urgent attention in research and policy making. We identify three main strategies by which agricultural water management can deal with these large trade-offs: (a) improving water management practices on agricultural lands, (b) better linkage with management of downstream aquatic ecosystems, and (c) paying more attention to how water can be managed to create multifunctional agro-ecosystems.

Alternative strategies have been developed such as the reuse of municipal wastewater for irrigation in agriculture. Despite numerous advantages for soil fertility and crop productivity, recycling wastewater in soils also has several ecotoxicological and sanitary problems. Few investigations have assessed the risk by evaluating the impact of wastewater irrigation on soil microbes. Here, we report for the first time the short- and long-term effects of treated municipal wastewater irrigation on the density and genetic structure of bacterial and fungal soil communities. Soils from agricultural sites in Tunisia that had been irrigated with wastewater for 4, 8, 16 and 26 years were characterised. Soil physicochemical and microbial characteristics were assessed by sampling at 0-20 and 20-40 cm depth at each site. Quantitative changes in bacterial and fungal communities were measured by indirect counts on synthetic culture media and qualitative modifications were evaluated by using molecular ecology methods: B- and F-ARISA for Bacterial and Fungal Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis, respectively. These methods allowed genotyping the structure of bacterial and fungal communities from soil DNA extracts. Our results revealed a significant increase in microbial densities related to the duration of irrigation with wastewater. In addition, wastewater irrigation led to changes in the genetic structure of bacterial and fungal communities, the magnitude and specificity of these changes being significantly correlated with the duration of such irrigation. These results show that wastewater management schemes have a major effect on indigenous microbial abundance and composition in soils that could be related to the recurrent inputs of organic compounds and mineral/metallic elements. In an agro-ecological context, irrigation with municipal wastewater represents an impacting practice that now needs to be evaluated more fully in terms of ecosystem services for sustainable agriculture. © 2009 INRA, EDP Sciences.",,"alternative agriculture; crop production; DNA; ecotoxicology; genetic structure; irrigation; microbial community; recycling; soil fertility; soil microorganism; wastewater; water resource; Mediterranean Sea; Tunisia; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951243440

However, our lack of understanding of the linkages between the human and natural components of ecosystems inhibits the implementation of the EA for policy decision-making. Coastal wetland systems provide many benefits and ecosystem services to humans, including nutrient recycling, climate and water quality regulation, timber, fuel and fibre, but they are under considerable threat from population pressure and climate change. In this chapter, we review the ecosystem services provided by coastal wetlands, and the threats to these services. We then present a new inte-grative conceptual framework to underpin the EA. The framework is divided into three sub-systems: one relating to ecosystem functions, one to ecosystem services, and one to social development and well-being. The pathways linking these sub-systems represent transfers of state, for example, ecosystem functions being transferred into ecosystem services, or ecosystem services being transferred into benefits. The focus of our approach is on enhancing the magnitude and efficiency of these transfers, by introducing or making use of any existing catalysts and overcoming any constraints in the system.

In this paper, we present the basic features of commercial forestry together with a review of novel approaches for ecologically oriented forestry. The ""new forestry"" advocates for multiple-species and structurally complex forests, and is directed toward a diverse array of objectives (ecosystem function, biodiversity conservation, wildlife habitats, visual quality, nutrient recycling, water retention, soil productivity, carbon sequestration, and amenity values), in addition to the provision of classic economic forestry commodities.In temperate forests, economic goals have not been abandoned. The challenge in these systems is to develop a new silvicultural approach that will keep forests sustainable and also fulfill their traditional timber production function. In Israel, the majority of forests are not economic in the traditional sense; therefore, the shift toward more ecological management should be easier. We discuss the applicability of ecological forestry to Israeli forests, suggesting ways by which forest management can be adapted for the new forestry objectives. The scientific community can aid this process by providing technical expertise to help bridge knowledge gaps. We hope that this discussion will help to create some common ground for discussions between conservationists and foresters in Israel in years to come. © 2009 Science From Israel/LPPLtd., Jerusalem.","Biodiversity; Ecological services; Ecosystem management; Forest management","biodiversity; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; environmental economics; forest management; silviculture; species diversity; sustainable forestry; Asia; Eurasia; Israel; Middle East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350340380

Looking out to 2060 and beyond, developments which may influence demand for minerals include climate change mitigation and adaptation; energy, food and raw material security; and new construction, manufacturing, recycling and re-use technologies. Factors influencing the supply side include the structure and ownership of the mining and quarrying industry, new extraction, processing and environmental technologies, ecosystem service provision, societal attitudes and land access. Although prediction carries a high level of uncertainty, continuous development of the regulatory framework is, and will remain, a major and pervasive factor in the relationship between mining and quarrying and land use. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.","Environment; Future land use; Mining; Planning; Quarrying; Regulation","land use change; land use planning; landscape planning; mining; policy strategy; quarrying; regulatory framework; spatial planning; strategic approach; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73249140529

The roles of fertilisation rate, composting of recycled plant residues and stage of the rotations in the overall impact of the cropping systems on soil quality and AM were also identified. The conventional cropping system with a non-leguminous crop rotation (barley-barley-rye-oat-potato-oat) was fertilised at either full or half the recommended rate. In the low-input cropping system, one year with barley was replaced by clover, and oat was cultivated mixed with pea. Straw and clover were returned to the soil either with or without composting. In the low-input system, biotite and rock phosphate were used to compensate for K and P in the harvested yield, while animal manure was applied at the start only. After 15 years, crop growth and nutrition, AMF colonisation and soil quality were assessed in the field, while the AM contribution to growth and nutrient uptake were determined in a bioassay in a growth chamber. AM functioning made a higher contribution to soil quality in terms of crop performance and environmental benefits in the low-input cropping system than at either fertilisation rate in the conventional system. Halving fertilisation in the conventional system prevented some costs and enhanced some of the benefits of AM in comparison with full fertilisation. However, only the low-input system with composting conclusively favoured AM in comparison with the conventional system. It resulted in the highest percentage colonisation and, in a bioassay with flax and clover, gave a relative average contribution to growth of 27% and to P uptake of 68% in comparison with 4 and 36%, respectively, for the conventional cropping system with full fertilisation. Rye yield was in the low-input system without composting similar to that in the conventional system with full fertilisation, and with composting 87% of the latter one. Incorporation of clover green manure without composting inhibited AM functioning, leading to a temporary loss of AM contribution to crop performance. This effect draws attention to the impact of the form of recycled organic matter on supporting ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We present a cost-effectiveness analysis of 13 catchment- and treatment-based management alternatives for mitigating Cryptosporidium risk in the Myponga water supply catchment, South Australia. A broad range of costs and benefits are identified and valued, including setup, operation and maintenance, and opportunity costs, and benefits for ecosystem services including water quality, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and farm production services. The results suggest that the cost-effectiveness of investment in water quality management can be substantially enhanced by considering the costs of management and the benefits for ecosystem services, in addition to Cryptosporidium removal effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness of investment in management alternatives is dependent upon the desired level of Cryptosporidium removal effectiveness by both the catchment and treatment barriers. The combination of a spatially targeted 25% restriction in water course access of nondairy cattle and treatment by enhanced coagulation provides the most (net) cost-effective Cryptosporidium risk mitigation strategy. This combination may achieve 0.614 log removal at a net cost of A$0.7 million and (net) cost-effectiveness of A$1.14 million per log removal. Additional risk mitigation can be achieved through the addition of ultraviolet irradiation treatment, higher levels of water course access restriction for cattle, and the adoption of dung beetles in the catchment. Economic valuation of a range of costs and benefits of management priorities can support cost-effective water quality management investment decisions and inform elements of policy design such as cost-sharing arrangements and spatial targeting.

Many of these estuaries no longer have healthy, productive reefs because of impacts from destructive fishing, sediment accumulation, pollution, and parasites. Once valued primarily as a fishery resource, increasing attention is being focused today on the array of other ecosystem services that oysters and the reefs they form provide in United States coastal bays and estuaries. Since the early 1990s efforts to restore subtidal and intertidal oyster reefs have increased significantly, with particular interest in small-scale community-based projects initiated most often by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). To date, such projects have been undertaken in at least 15 US states, for both species of dominant native oysters along the United States coast. Community-based restoration practitioners have used a broad range of nonmutually exclusive approaches, including: (1) oyster gardening of hatchery-produced oysters; (2) deployment of juvenile to adult shellfish (""broodstock"") within designated areas for stock enhancement; and (3) substrate enhancement using natural or recycled man-made materials loose or in ""bags"" designed to enhance local settlement success. Many of these approaches are inspired by fishery-enhancement efforts of the past, though are implemented with different outcomes in mind (ecological services vs. fishery outcomes). This paper was originally presented at the first West Coast Restoration Workshop in 2006 in San Rafael, California and is intended to summarize potential approaches for small-scale restoration projects, including some emerging methods, and highlight the logistical benefits and limitations of these approaches. Because the majority of the past efforts have been with C. viriginica, we use those examples initially to highlight efforts with the intent of enlightening current west coast United States efforts with Ostrea lurida. We also discuss site-specific characteristics including ""recruitment bottlenecks"" and ""substrate limitation"" as criteria for identifying the most appropriate approaches to use for small-scale restoration projects. Many of the included ""lessons-learned"" from the smaller-scale restoration projects being implemented today can be used to inform not only large-scale estuary wide efforts to restore C. virginica, but also the relatively nascent efforts directed at restoring the United States west coast's native Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida.",,"Crassostrea virginica; Ostrea conchaphila; Ostrea lurida; Ostreidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649241813

Wendl. plantations on the soil surface conditions and vascular plant composition in central Tunisia. Landscape function analysis (LFA) indices of soil stability, infiltration, and nutrient recycling underneath A. saligna increased by 1%, 138%, and 148%, respectively, in comparison to bare areas. This species, however, did not affect indicators of soil surface functionality, the spatial pattern of resource sinks-sources, or vascular plant species composition at a plot scale. This was probably due to low A. saligna cover, and a limited degree of litter incorporation into the soil surface.

Microorganisms provide important ecosystem services, such as nutrient recycling, organic matter mineralization and degradation of pollutants. In this study, effects of exposure to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin on the bacterial diversity and pollutant degradation in natural marine sediments were studied using molecular methods (T-RFLP) in combination with radiorespirometry. In a microcosm experiment, sediment spiked with 14C-labelled pyrene was exposed to five concentrations of ciprofloxacin (0, 20, 200, 1000 and 2000 μg L-1) in a single dose to the overlying water. The production of 14CO2 (i.e. complete mineralization of pyrene) was measured during 11 weeks. Sediment samples for bacterial community structure analysis were taken after 7 weeks. Results showed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of pyrene mineralization measured as the total 14CO2 production. The nominal EC50 was calculated to 560 μg L-1, corresponding to 0.4 μg/kg d.w. sediment. The lowest effect concentration on the bacterial community structure was 200 μg L-1, which corresponds to 0.1 μg/kg d.w. sediment.

In order to obtain insight into the influence of various environmental factors on flood propagation and distribution in this system, an analysis was undertaken of a 30year record of hydrometric data (discharges and water levels) from one of the Delta distributaries. The analysis revealed that water levels and discharges at any given channel site in this distributary are influenced by a complex interplay of flood wave and local rainfall inputs, modified by channelfloodplain interactions, in-channel sedimentation and technical interventions, both at the given site and upstream. Additionally, cyclical variation of channel vegetation due to intermittent nutrient loading, possibly sustained by nutrient recycling, may play a role. It is shown that short and longterm flood dynamics are mainly due to variation in floodplain flows. As a consequence, discharge data collected within the main channels of distributaries do not adequately represent flooding dynamics in the system.

An effective use of animal waste resources might provide a partial, but still important, contribution in reducing net CO2 emissions. In particular: the fulfilment of nutrient requirements of crop plants growing in non-limiting conditions and thus sequestering CO 2 at their potential level; the chance of diminishing the use of fossil energy, and related CO2 emissions, required for manufacturing industrial fertilizers; the possibility of enhancing carbon sequestration in agricultural soils by the application of farmyard manure. The future success of agriculture in providing these ecosystem services can only be achieved with a changed social awareness of the links between sustainable land use and global environmental change. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

They provide a number of ecosystem services; biological control, pollination, seed dispersal, seed germination and nutrient recycling. However their habitats are under increasing pressure from threats such as urban expansion, industrial agriculture, logging, mining and pollution. In order to ensure that our migrants return each spring, we must also work to conserve their vital habitat beyond our borders. Birds are important to conserve in their own right as they are an effective indicator taxon for environmental change; they are relatively large and diurnal, birds are close to ubiquitous geographically, are high on the food chain therefore reflecting change in a diversity of organisms and they are relatively long-lived so studies can be conducted over a number of years. Their distribution therefore helps us to identify areas where measures to conserve biodiversity are especially critical. Not all sites can be conserved so Important Bird Areas (IBAs) have been identified which are conservation priorities. Sites selected as IBAs are effective in capturing a high proportion of threatened, endemic and representative wildlife species other than birds. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024162519

Thus, the maintenance and restoration of oyster reefs is vital for properly functioning estuarine ecosystems. We hypothesized that spatially heterogeneous and refuge-rich reefs are superior habitats for oysters and associated invertebrates and fishes. If this is shown to be the case, then vertical structure and refuge should be included in the design of newly constructed oyster reefs and conserved in existing reefs. To test our hypothesis, models were built as concrete blocks into which shells were placed horizontally, vertically, and widely spaced, and vertically and closely spaced. Respectively, the units represent horizontal orientation with no refuge (HNR), vertical orientation with no refuge (VNR), and vertical orientation with refuge (VWR). Flume studies of velocity distributions over each model type showed distinctive differences that may contribute to differential settlement on the models in the absence of predators or sediment. A subsequent settlement study in the same flume showed significantly higher settlement densities to horizontal shells than to vertical shells regardless of refuge (HNR>VNR=VWR). This result indicates the primary importance of settlement surface orientation (horizontal vs. vertical) over predation refuge when predators are absent. In contrast, two field recruitment studies indicated that the importance of orientation relative to predation refuge might depend on sedimentation rates. When sedimentation was low, the number of oysters and barnacles (live, dead, and total) was significantly higher on no-refuge models than on refuge models (HNR=VNR>VWR). However, percent mortality was lower on the refuge models than on the no refuge models (HNR=VNR>VWR). This leads to a conclusion that although fewer oysters may settle on refuge shells, those that do have a higher rate of survival. In a year when sedimentation was high, recruitment and survival of oysters, barnacles, and bryozoans was higher on vertical models regardless of refuge. In aggregate, our results indicate that both vertical orientation and predation refuge are critical to the early development of the oyster reef community and should be included in restoration designs. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the city, they can be implemented in roof tops, abandoned industrial areas, vertical surfaces of buildings, backyards, porches and public parks. In the suburbs, greywater can be treated in private gardens and reused for irrigation. The performance and control restraints often found disappointing in nature-based systems have been overcome in the past two decades: current systems achieve effluent qualities similar to conventional sewage treatment plants. With area requirements expected to come down to 2.0 m2 per p.e. they would need only two or three times more space. To the core task of treating wastewater they add valuable ecosystem services like micro-climate regulation, rainwater retention, production of renewable energy and/or food, air filtering, noise reduction and recreational values as biotopes with flora and fauna. They represent a new philosophy of dealing with wastes: recycling of nutrients from a valuable resource instead of mere disposal. The new concepts of closing loops call for a more integrated approach represented by the ecological engineer.

Knowledge of recent changes in land use, driving forces and implications of changes within the context of sustainable development is limited. This study analyses the changes in spatial patterns of agricultural land use, crop diversity, manure input, yield, soil loss and run-off from cropland, and dependence of agroecosystems on forests, during the 1963-1993 period in a small watershed in central Himalaya, India. Data obtained from existing maps, interpretation of satellite imagery, geographic information system (GIS) based land-use change analysis, participatory survey and field measurements were integrated to quantify changes at the landscape/watershed scale. During the 1963-1993 period, agricultural land use increased by 30% at the cost of loss of 5% of forestland. About 60% of agricultural expansion occurred in community forests compared to 35% in protected forests and 5% in reserve forests. Agricultural expansion was most conspicuous at higher elevations (1800-2600m) and on medium slopes (10-30°). Cultivation of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum L., Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertner), hogmillet (Panicum miliaceum L.) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) Beauv.) was abandoned. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), a cash crop, completely replaced the abandoned crops and partially replaced many other traditional crops. Soil loss, run-off and manure input related to potato cultivation was much higher compared to other crops. Mean annual fodder yield from cropland declined by 44%, while manure input, soil loss and run-off increased by 46, 90 and 51%, respectively. Changes in land use and management have improved household income but at the cost of increase in intensity of biomass removal from forests and loss of forest cover. As farm productivity is dependent on forests, continued depletion of forest resources will result in poor economic returns from agriculture to local people together with loss of global benefits from forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. Policy support for sustainable income from forests to local people as well as technologies enhancing agricultural productivity through conservation of traditional crop diversity and efficient resource recycling within agroecosystems is needed for sustainable livelihood of local communities together with global benefits from the Himalayan forests and ecosystem services. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The concept includes two areas of emphasis - education and assessment - both based soundly on principles of soil science. Soil quality test kits, farmer-based scorecards, visual assessment procedures, fact sheets, and video presentations were developed as educational materials because many people have no basis to recognize, understand or appreciate the complexity of soil resources. Assessment tools for indexing soil quality at various scales were pursued to show the multiple functions (e.g. nutrient and water cycling, filtering and buffering of contaminants, decomposition of crop residues and other organic matter sources, and recycling of essential plant nutrients) that soils provide as the foundation for sustainable land management. Worldwide research and technology transfer efforts have increased awareness that soil resources have both inherent characteristics determined by their basic soil formation factors and dynamic characteristics influenced by human decisions and management practices. Soil quality assessment and education are intended to provide a better understanding and awareness that soil resources are truly living bodies with biological, chemical, and physical properties and processes performing essential ecosystem services. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Beginning about 10,000 years ago, however, settled agriculture allowed the division of labor, rise of civilizations, and utilization of terrestrial resources at rates greater than those of replenishment. Demographic estimates put our numbers at 9-10 billion by 2050. About 85 percent of humanity now resides in the Developing Nations, and this proportion is growing. Due to the global information network, this is the first world generation to become acutely aware of the high standard of living confined to the Industrialized Nations. The grossly inequitable distribution of wealth, due partly to Earth resource exploitation, is resented by many people of the Developing Nations; this situation is politically destabilizing and must be ameliorated. But can 10 billion people be afforded comfortable lives without destroying the planetary carrying capacity and habitability through exhaustion of the Earth's natural capital? Humans now control a third of the terrestrial net primary biological production, and our share is increasing. Adverse environmental impacts include increasing air and water pollution; accelerating loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services, topsoil, fisheries, and tropical rain forests; and global warming + sea-level rise. Prospects for the intricate web of life are ominous. Modern societies are sustained by the extraction of fossil energy, water, and other Earth materials far exceeding planetary renewal rates. Island communities provide sobering examples of the collapse of cultures that have overexploited and devastated their environments. Thus, humanity must reach a steady-state stewardship of the planet involving super-efficient, universal mineral resource recovery and conservation while preserving ecosystem integrity. Utilization of renewable resources at or below recharge rates and near-total recycling of nonrenewable Earth materials can only be accomplished employing widely available, inexpensive energy. Unfortunately, the Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that a portion of the mineral resources and most of the spent energy are irretrievably lost. Scientific research-generated technological advances providing production and ubiquitous availability of low-environmentalimpact, cheap energy will be essential to preserving anything approaching steady-state resource utilization. Assuming technical, economic, and political success in achieving global equity and prosperity for 10 billion people (a very large order indeed!), the world ecosystem will be severely compromised through increased human consumption of the Earth's mineral resources. Biospheric equilibrium and ecosystem sustainability—the very carrying capacity of the planet—is already at risk, and this risk is increasing. Without doubt, the greatest long-term challenge facing humanity involves the preservation of a functioning, viable biosphere. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"conservation; extraction; mineral exploration; mineral resource; natural resource; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037965990

The doubling of agricultural food production during the past 35 years was associated with a 6.87-fold increase in nitrogen fertilization, a 3.48-fold increase in phosphorus fertilization, a 1.68-fold increase in the amount of irrigated cropland, and a 1.1-fold increase in land in cultivation. Based on a simple linear extension of past trends, the anticipated next doubling of global food production would be associated with approximately 3-fold increases in nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization rates, a doubling of the irrigated land area, and an 18% increase in cropland. These projected changes would have dramatic impacts on the diversity, composition, and functioning of the remaining natural ecosystems of the world, and on their ability to provide society with a variety of essential ecosystem services. The largest impacts would be on freshwater and marine ecosystems, which would be greatly eutrophied by high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus release from agricultural fields. Aquatic nutrient eutrophication can lead to loss of biodiversity, outbreaks of nuisance species, shifts in the structure of food chains, and impairment of fisheries. Because of aerial redistribution of various forms of nitrogen, agricultural intensification also would eutrophy many natural terrestrial ecosystems and contribute to atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases. These detrimental environmental impacts of agriculture can be minimized only if there is much more efficient use and recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in agroecosystems.",,"nitrogen; phosphorus; agriculture; biodiversity; conference paper; crop; ecology; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; food industry; greenhouse effect; irrigation (agriculture); land use; marine environment; nonhuman; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033052530

Among these are nutrient retention and humic production by wetlands, nutrient retention and woody habitat production by riparian forests, food web structures that cha nnel phosphorus to consumers rather than phytoplankton, and biogeochemical mechanisms that inhibit phosphorus recycling from sediments. In degraded lakes, these resilience mechanisms are replaced by new ones that connect lakes to larger, regional economi c and social systems. New controls that maintain degraded lakes include runoff from agricultural and urban areas, absence of wetlands and riparian forests, and changes in lake food webs and biogeochemistry that channel phosphorus to blooms of nuisance al gae. Economic analyses show that degraded lakes are significantly less valuable than normal lakes. Because of this difference in value, the economic benefits of restoring lakes could be used to create incentives for lake restoration.

In the 1990s Americans annually removed 70% more timber from the forest than in 1900. Since 1900 population rose more than three times and gross domestic product (GDP) per person almost five. Despite more people, affluence, and logging, U.S. forest area remained constant. Since mid-century, standing timber volume rose nearly 30%. Consumers, millers, and foresters, responding to changes in style, ethics, and technology, have contributed to these outcomes. We examine the role of each actor in the industrial ecology of forests for their leverage for sparing forests. Consumers lessened their use of wood products per GDP (Intensity of Use) during the century by 2.5% annually to offset expanding population and GDP per person, a trend that will level or lower timber consumption if population and affluence grow as expected. Millers became highly efficient at utilizing wood and recycled fiber for their material or energy, a success that limits their future leverage. Foresters have leverage to grow trees faster and thus use less forest land to grow and harvest timber Steady or declining demand for trees coupled to productive forests could spare more U.S. forest land for sequestering carbon, ecosystem services, and habitat for nature.","Forest land; Forest management; Industrial ecology; Intensity of use; Material efficiency; Timber removals",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000197192

Of primary importance is the decrease in water quality due to urban storm water runoff. A number of communities have initiated restoration strategies to improve water quality standards. One such strategy in the incorporation of riparian walkways with native flora. As a result of such restoration efforts, habitats for native fauna have improved, and the number and diversity of wildlife have increased in urban settings. Restoration of urban habitats also provides social and economic benefits to he surrounding community. Efforts to mitigate the loss of ecological resources by restoring native habitats on lots that cannot be developed or on abandoned lots hold a high, unrealized potential. Habitat restoration not only provides natural diversions to urban surroundings, but also enlightens and educates individual citizens about the importance of balanced ecosystems and the role of humans within ecosystems. Education is the primary step toward creating ecologically sustainable communities.","Ecology education; Habitat restoration; Sustainability; Urban renewal; Waterways","runoff; storm water; ecosystem; food industry; land use; priority journal; river; short survey; urban area; waste water recycling; water quality; Riparia",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029002369
