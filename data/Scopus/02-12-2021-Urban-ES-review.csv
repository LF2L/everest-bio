However, climate change and urbanisation have put significant pressure on ecosystems and compelled nations and territories in Oceania to urgently adapt. This article, with a focus on Pacific Island Oceania but some insight from Aotearoa New Zealand, reviews key literature focused on ecosystem health and human health and wellbeing in Oceania and the important potential contribution of nature-based solutions to limiting the negative impacts of climate change and urbanisation. The inextricable link between human well-being and provision of ecosystem services is well established. However, given the uniqueness of Oceania, rich in cultural and biological diversity and traditional ecological knowledge, these links require further examination leading potentially to a new conceptualisation of wellbeing frameworks in relation to human/nature relationships. Rapidly urbanising Oceania has a growing body of rural, peri-urban and urban nature-based solutions experience to draw from. However, important gaps in knowledge and practice remain. Pertinently, there is a need, potential—and there-fore opportunity—to define an urban design agenda positioned within an urban ecosystem services framework, focused on human wellbeing and informed by traditional ecological knowledge, determined by and relevant for those living in the islands of Oceania as a means to work towards effective urban climate change adaptation. © 2021 by the authors.

While the uptake of ES in urban areas is deeply entangled with multiple values, trade-offs, institutions, management and planning approaches, there is still a lack of a comprehensive and systematic framework to address environmental justice (EJ) in urban ES assessments. This article presents a systematic literature review to examine what factors are critical for the effective inclusion of an EJ lens in urban ES appraisals. More specifically, we assessed how distributional, procedural and recognitional EJ dimensions have been addressed, and in relation to which types of urban ES. Our results reveal that EJ considerations are currently focused on the (un)equal distribution of ES and the associated green and blue infrastructure with regard to socioeconomic groups, with special attention to income and race/ethnicity as the main mechanisms of social stratification. There is also a predominant focus on regulating and cultural ES, analyzing their role on resilience and adaptive capacity on one hand, and recreational values, social cohesion and place-making on the other. In this review, we also evaluate the interconnected dimensions of justice and their constraints, and lay out pathways for new research into intersectional and restorative approaches to justice in ES assessments. Finally, we interrogate what the role of urban ES-based planning might be in making more inclusive and just cities and explore its implications for policy and practice. © 2021 The Authors","Cities; Environmental benefits; Equity; Green spaces; Trade-offs; Urban green infrastructure","ecosystem service; environmental justice; literature review; social change; sustainability; trade-off; urban ecosystem; urban planning",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105847436

This review article aims to highlight the relevance and knowledge gaps regarding GBI from the perspective of the food–energy–water (FEW) nexus, these being key resources for the survival of human communities. In particular, this review was focused on publications on urban ecosystem services (positive effects) and dis-services (negative effects) associated with different GBI typologies. The review proved that GBI can contribute environmentally, socially, and economically to FEW security and urban sustainability. Yet, such positive effects must be considered against ecosystem dis-services tradeoffs, including urban food production, commonly connected with heavy water and energy consumption, specifically under dry climate conditions, and sometimes related to an excessive use of manure, pesticides, or fertilizers. These conditions could pose either a risk to water quality and local insect survival or serve enhanced mosquito breeding because of irrigation. Up to now, the review evidenced that few nexus modeling techniques have been discussed in terms of their benefits, drawbacks, and applications. Guidance is provided on the choice of an adequate modeling approach. Water, energy, and food are intrinsically associated physically. However, depending on their management, their tradeoffs are often increased. There is a need to minimize these tradeoffs and to build up synergies between food, energy, and water using a holistic approach. This is why the FEW nexus approach offers good insights to address the relation between three important individual resource components of sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

As a result, connecting urban ecosystem services of different urban land uses is imperative for urban sustainability and resilience. In conventional land use planning, urban agriculture (UA) and urban stormwater management are treated as separate economic sectors with different-disconnected-ecosystem services. Furthermore, few studies have synthesized knowledge regarding the potential impacts of integration of UA and stormwater green infrastructures (GIs) on the quantity and quality of urban ecosystem services of both economic sectors. This study provides a detailed analysis of the imperative question—how should a city integrate the developments of both urban agriculture and stormwater green infrastructure to overcome barriers while enhancing the ecosystem services? To answer this question, we con-ducted an extensive literature review. The results show that integrating UA with GIs can enhance urban food production while protecting urban water quality. This paper provides an initial context and mechanisms for future researchers and city planners regarding the manner in which the syner-gies between UA and stormwater GIs can create greater value for the wellbeing of urban ecosystems and resilience in the circular economy. © 2021 by the authors.

Urban green space is the main carrier for providing urban ecosystem services. The acceleration of the urbanization process poses a threat to the stock of urban green space. It is difficult for urban ecosystem services to meet the residents demand. The traditional urban green space evaluation indicators mainly evaluate the urban green space area. Those indicators are always integrated and two-dimensional, ignoring the three-dimensional green quantity and the quality of ecosystem services. Based on the above background, this paper proposes an evaluation indicator of urban ecosystem service function—urban ecological comfort index, which makes quality feedback on the urban ecosystem service function through the subjective feelings of the human body. Combined with the grey correlation analysis method, the evaluation model of the index is constructed. Through the comparative analysis of the conditions of the samples, it is concluded that when the green view index is lower than 30%, the main influencing factor of urban ecological comfort index is green view index; when the green view index is higher than 30%, the main influencing factors are humidity, PM2.5 concentration, and wind power level. Comparing the simulation results of the evaluation model with the measured values, the results show that the change trends of two sets of data are basically the same, indicating that the evaluation model is scientific and effective. © 2021 Science Press.

While literature on ES valuation has grown in recent years, its application to urban contexts is still limited. Twenty-five papers, which include 29 different case studies, carry out an economic valuation and have undergone an in-depth analysis. The papers have been selected out of 80 papers detected through keywords. Six different valuation methodologies have been employed in the case studies. The most common ESs valued at the urban level are air quality regulation, local climate regulation, carbon sequestration and storage, and aesthetic appreciation and inspiration for culture, art, and design. The methodologies recur with different frequencies in the valuation of ESs at the urban level. Choice modeling and contingent valuation methodologies are used to value a variety of ESs, including regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Other methodologies are used to value only specific ESs. The replacement cost and damage cost avoided methodologies are used for the assessment of regulation services only; the travel cost method and contingent valuation are used for cultural services only. The results indicate that the considered valuation methodologies show different levels of appropriateness with respect to specific ES categories. Therefore, there is a need to expand the application of valuation methodologies to capture the value of all ESs provided by natural resources, in order to protect and enhance them. © 2021 by the authors.

The ecosystem services concept synthesises human–environmental interactions through a series of combined components of biodiversity and abiotic elements, linking ecological processes and functions. The concept of green infrastructure (GI) in the urban context emphasises the quality and quantity of urban and peri-urban green spaces and natural areas. In dense urban contexts, the applications of GI are limited and not applied to the potential urban spaces such as roofs and gardens. Often, roofs are characterised by impermeable paved surfaces with negative effects on human well-being, whereas garden designs do not consider social needs and environmental interactions. The role of urban stressors or the urban context as a driving force or pressure of urban green space is not always well understood and employed in the planning of green spaces. This is partly due to a knowledge gap between different science disciplines that operate on different scales, from single processes of the plants (which focus on plant responses to environmental stresses affecting human well-being) to urban ecosystems (which focus on the biodiversity and urban space planning–human well-being relationship). This can create a paradox, as green spaces that are not adequately designed might not produce the expected effects. In this paper, an overview of benefits and limitations of applying the ecosystem services approach when designing green spaces is presented. The focus is on the main urban ecosystem services provided by green roofs and community gardens such as GI that can represent strategies to provide ecological and social multifunctionality to waterproofed surfaces connected to the buildings and low-exploited gardens being the main areas that affect dense urban settlements, and thus, increasing the ecosystem services in the urban environment, such as reducing the Urban Heat Island, as well as flooding events. Specifically, the paper highlights (i) feedback between ecological processes and functions that support ecosystem services, (ii) urban environmental stresses in relation to disservices that these can create for human well-being and (iii) key issues that should be considered in the planning and design of urban ecosystem services. Such a new vision of urban ecosystem services highlights the need to look at GI as an active part of the urban space design in the built environment. © 2021 by the authors.

The pattern of urban green space which takes fairness and efficiency into account is an important method to enhance the human settlements environment and improve people's livelihood. On the basis of clarifying the relevant concepts and connotations, based on Citespace software, keyword co-emerging network analysis and cluster analysis of urban green space ecosystem services, residents' health and human well-being and their similar concepts can be found: The research clusters are highly concentrated, the research fields under each cluster have a high degree of overlap, and the research scale is also more refined. The differentiation of urban green space and the urban built environment and leisure physical activity and health spatial has become the research hot spots in recent years. In this paper, the correlation research between urban green space ecosystem services and residents' health is systematically summarized from the following four aspects: 1 ) Supply side, which mainly includes the types of urban green space ecosystem services as well as their evaluation and measurement methods; 2) demand side, that is, the measurement methods of urban residents' health and human well-being needs and their temporal and spatial expression; 3) the matching of supply and demand, relating to the matching method of supply and demand of urban green space ecosystem services and spatial equity; 4) and the promotion and regulation, including optimization of spatial and temporal structure of urban green space and efficient service. It is pointed out that the existing research on the supply and demand matching of urban green space ecosystem services needs to be further deepened and improved in terms of research content, research logic, research methods and results. Future research needs to pay more attention to the spatial characteristics of urban green space ecosystem services and the matching degree of supply and demand at the level of residents' health needs. The spatial form, functional structure and element organization of multidimensional urban green space efficient service under the equilibrium state of supply and demand are summarized through the coupling with refined and normative research of residents' health temporal and spatial behaviors in the context of new data environment.

However, research on UES in the Global South has not been reviewed as systematically as in the Global North. In Southeast Asia, the nature and extent of the biases, imbalances and gaps in UES research are unclear. We address this issue by conducting a systematic review of UES research in Southeast Asia over the last twenty years. Our findings draw attention to the unequal distribution of UES research within the region, and highlight common services, scales and features studied, as well as methods undertaken in UES research. We found that while studies tend to assess regulating and cultural UES at a landscape scale, few studies examined interactions between services by assessing synergies and tradeoffs. Moreover, the bias in research towards megacities in the region may overlook less-developed nations, rural areas, and peri-urban regions and their unique perspectives and preferences towards UES management. We discuss the challenges and considerations for integrating and conducting research on UES in Southeast Asia based on its unique and diverse socio-cultural characteristics. We conclude our review by highlighting aspects of UES research that need more attention in order to support land use planning and decision-making in Southeast Asia. © 2021 by the authors.

With an aim to examine the emerging research trends and gaps in UES, we present an up-to-date, computer-based meta-analysis of UES from 2010 to 2019 by implementing a keyword co-occurrence network (KCN) approach. A total of 10,247 author keywords were selected and used to analyze undirected and weighted networks of these keywords. Specifically, power-law distribution fitting was performed to identify overall UES keyword trends, and clusters of keywords were examined to understand micro-level knowledge trends. The knowledge components and structures of UES literature exhibited scale-free network characteristics, which implies that the KCN of the UES throughout the 2010s was dominated by a small number of keywords such as “urbanization”, “land use and land cover”, “urban green space” and “green infrastructure”. Finally, our findings indicate that knowledge of stakeholder involvement and qualitative aspects of UES are not as refined as spatial UES approaches. The implications of these knowledge components and trends are discussed in the context of urban sustainability and policy planning. © 2020 by the authors.

Thus, it is urgent to adopt mitigation strategies that allow diminishing these impacts. Greenery systems could contribute to many urban ecosystem services as the thermal performance of buildings, removal of atmospheric pollutants, stormwater management, and carbon sequestration, among others. Many of these ecosystem services are linked to soil functions, but until now, the most advanced knowledge about growing medium performance comes from temperate and subtropical cities, where commercial or engineering reasons have dominated the growing medium formulation. As artificial growing medium usually contains natural and human-made materials, they belong to the Technosols group and therefore are subject to the different pedogenetic processes. As a result of the mix of the used materials and variable environmental conditions to which they are exposed, Technosols could modify their properties and impact on the greenery system performance. To adapt the greenery system technologies to semiarid and arid cities, we present a review of the available information of growing medium formulation. We also propose to re-think the Technosol design from a pedological point of view, taking into account the soil quality framework, useful not only for the Technosol design but also for its monitoring performance through time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Green façades; Green roofs; Growing media; Living walls; Soil quality framework","carbon sequestration; environmental conditions; monitoring; performance assessment; soil quality; soil type; urban ecosystem",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083852224

Yet, justice remains a ‘blind spot’ in urban ecosystem service models and research, which can be traced back to the ecological and economic legacies of the concept itself. This legacy reproduces the normative focus on natural capital as a guarantee of sustaining ecosystem services, enforces a static understanding of nature that insufficiently considers human agency, and conceptualizes ecosystem service flows from nature to humans in a way that does not reflect the social-ecological structure and constantly shifting priorities of the urban realm. In response, this conceptual paper aims at broadening the analytical foundation for justice in urban ecosystem service assessments by presenting a model that links the co-production of urban ecosystem services (including infrastructure, institutions, and perceptions) with established lines of recognition, procedural, and distributional justice. It further highlights the need to embed these classical dimensions of justice within both spatial (downscaled and inter-scalar approaches) and temporal (interrelated past, present, and future conditions) justice frames. Relying on urban environmental, social, spatial and temporal justice theory as well ecosystem service scholarship, we outline theoretical entry points and provide practical examples for weaving notions of justice into urban ecosystem service research and practice, while highlighting future research needs. © 2020 The Authors","Ecosystem services; Environmental justice; Equity; Plural values; Spatial justice; Temporal justice","city; ecosystem; human; human experiment; justice; perception; review; theoretical study",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083490174

These structures can provide important ecosystem services (ES) with a major impact on human well-being. With respect to urban planning, special consideration must be given to such green infrastructure types when implementing measures to maintain and enhance the quality of life. Therefore, generating knowledge on the urban ES of differently scaled green infrastructure types is important. This systematic literature review provides an overview of existing studies which have explicitly investigated the urban ES of differently spatial-scaled green infrastructure types. By reviewing 76 publications, we confirm rising academic interest in this topic. The most frequently assessed urban ES belong to the category Regulating and Maintenance. Only a few have considered individual small structures such as green roofs or single gardens; green spaces are often aggregated into one, mostly city-wide, object of investigation, with resulting oversimplifications. Moreover, generalizing methods are mostly applied. Simultaneously, many studies have applied methods to evaluate location-specific primary data. More research is needed on small-scale structures, in particular to consider site-, and thus location-specific, parameters in order to successfully implement the ES concept into urban planning and to obtain realistic results for ES assessments. © 2020 by the authors.","Assessment; Cities; Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Site; Systematic literature review; Urban ecosystem services; Urban planning",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085649068

However, the application of this concept in planning and enhancing climate change resilience is negligible in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This article reviews state-of-the-art research on the potential contribution of peri-urban ecosystem services to climate change resilience in SSA and identifies research gaps for further work. This study was conducted through systematic review of articles from the Web of Science. The literature shows limited knowledge on peri-urban ecosystem services research globally and SSA in particular. The gaps in this knowledge stem from inadequate conceptualization and lack of understanding about how such knowledge can be translated into policy, planning and management and, hence, realizing development goals. In nutshell, the potential for climate change resilience of well-managed peri-urban ecosystem services includes reducing the physical exposure of peri-urban areas to floods and droughts and minimizing climate change risks through increased socio-economic resilience to hazard impacts and provision of the carbon sequestration function. However, specific peri-urban studies describing ecosystem service types and how they can be synchronized into mainstream urban planning and climate change resilience strategies are lacking in most SSA urban regions/landscapes. Therefore, case studies need to be conducted to contextualize and downscale the concept in peri-urban areas and to determine how the concept can be synchronized into broad urban planning and strategies for enhancing resilience to climate change in vulnerable urban and peri-urban communities. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate change; Planning and management; Policy; Sustainable development; Urban landscape",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079825598

Although an indicator-based approach has been widely used for urban green spaces multifunctionality assessment, a variation in assessment methods still exists. The comparability of the assessment results across cities thus becomes difficult. This article reviewed 94 studies which included more than a single urban ES. The findings demonstrate a variation in the coverage of multifunctionality, indicator types, assessment methods, scoring systems, and the consideration of two important concepts: trade-offs and ecosystem service demands. A standardized assessment framework for urban ecosystems is therefore proposed. It contains five features: enabling users to select ecosystem structures, enabling users to assess the same ecosystem services which are mandatory, enabling users to select indicator types to suit their data availability, the use of reference values to have informative results, and integration of the analysis of trade-offs or ecosystem service demands.

This is timely in light of contemporary interest in municipal tree planting and urban greening, defined as organized or semi-organized efforts to introduce, conserve, or maintain outdoor vegetation in urban areas. In response to injunctions from scholars and urban greening trends, this article provides an interdisciplinary review on urban trees, air quality, and asthma. We assess the scientific literature by reviewing refereed review papers and empirical studies on the biophysical processes through which urban trees affect air quality, as well as associated models that extend estimates to asthma outcomes. We then review empirical evidence of observed links between urban trees and asthma, followed by a discussion on implications for urban landscape planning and design. This review finds no scientific consensus that urban trees reduce asthma by improving air quality. In some circumstances, urban trees can degrade air quality and increase asthma. Causal pathways between urban trees, air quality, and asthma are very complex, and there are substantial differences in how natural science and epidemiology approach this issue. This may lead to ambiguity in scholarship, municipal decision-making, and landscape planning. Future research on this topic, as well as on urban ecosystem services and urban greening, should embrace epistemological and etiological pluralism and be conducted through interdisciplinary teamwork. © 2019",,"Air quality; Decision making; Ecosystems; Reforestation; Urban planning; Biophysical process; Empirical studies; Human health effects; Interdisciplinary research; Interdisciplinary teamwork; Landscape planning; Scientific literature; Urban landscape planning; Diseases; air quality; asthma; ecosystem service; epidemiology; interdisciplinary approach; landscape planning; literature review; public health; urban design; urban ecosystem; urban planning",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063747684

This paper aimed to identify remote sensing (RS) data/techniques used in the literature in five years (2013–2017) for UES investigation and to analyze the similarity between them. For this purpose, we used the Scopus database of scientific journals, and a set of appropriate filters were applied. A total of 44 studies were selected, being 93.18% of them located in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in Europe. The most common dataset used was the secondary data, followed by the Landsat family products. Land use and land cover (LULC) was the most common approach utilized, succeeded by radiometric indexes and band related. All four main classes (provision, regulation, supporting, and cultural) of ecosystem services (ES) were identified in the reviewed papers, wherein regulating services were the most popular modality mentioned. Seven different groups were established as having 100% of similarity between methods and ES results. Therefore, RS is identified in the literature as an important technique to reach this goal. However, we highlight the lack of studies in the southern hemisphere. © 2019 by the authors.

Socio-economic activities drive material and energy flows in cities that influence the health of ecosystems inside and outside the urban system. Recent studies suggest that these flows, under the urban metabolism (UM) metaphor, can be extended to encompass the assessment of urban ecosystem services (UES). Advancing UM approaches to assess UES may be a valuable solution to these arising sustainability challenges, which can support urban planning decisions. This paper critically reviews UM literature related to the UES concept and identifies approaches that may allow or improve the assessment of UES within UM frameworks. We selected from the UM literature 42 studies that encompass UES aspects, and analysed them on the following key investigation themes: temporal information, spatial information, system boundary aspects and cross-scale indicators. The analysis showed that UES are rarely acknowledged in UMliterature, and that existing UM approaches have limited capacity to capture the complexity of spatio-temporal and multi-scale information underpinning UES, which has hampered the implementation of operational decision support systems so far. We use these results to identify and illustrate pathways towards a UM-UES modelling approach. Our review suggests that cause-effect dynamics should be integrated with the UM framework, based on spatially-specific social, economic and ecological data. System dynamics can inform on the causal relationships underpinning UES in cities and, therefore, can help moving towards a knowledge base tool to support urban planners in addressing urban challenges. © 2019 by the authors.","Ecosystem services; Multiscale; Socio-ecological impacts; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Sustainability; Urban metabolism","decision making; ecosystem service; literature review; operations technology; sustainability; urban area; urban planning",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067106617

This provides tremendous opportunities for enhancing urban sustainability, and using ""nature in cities"" is critical to more resilient solutions to urban challenges. Terms for ""urban nature"" include Green Infrastructure (GI), Green-Blue Infrastructure (GBI), Urban Green Space (UGS), and Nature-Based Solutions (NBS). These terms, and the concepts they represent, are incomplete because they tend to reduce the importance of non-terrestrial ecological features in cities. We argue that the concept of Urban Ecological Infrastructure (UEI), which came from a 2013 forum held in Beijing and from several subsequent 2017 publications, is a more inclusive alternative. In this paper we refine the 2013 definition of UEI and link the concept more directly to urban ecosystem services. In our refined definition, UEI comprises all parts of a city that support ecological structures and functions, as well as the ecosystem services provided by UEI that directly affect human outcomes and wellbeing. UEI often includes aspects of the built environment, and we discuss examples of this ""hybrid infrastructure"". We distinguish terrestrial, aquatic, and wetland UEI because each type provides different ecosystem services. We present several examples of both ""accidental"" UEI and UEI that was explicitly designed and managed, with an emphasis on wetland UEI because these ecotonal ecosystems are uniquely both terrestrial and aquatic. We show how both accidental and planned UEI produces unexpected ecosystem services, which justifies recognizing and maintaining both purposeful and serendipitous types of UEI in cities. Finally, we posit that by incorporating both ""ecological"" and ""infrastructure"", UEI also helps to bridge urban scientists and urban practitioners in a more transdisciplinary partnership to build more resilient and sustainable cities. © 2019 University of California Press.

However, the benefits which are derived from urban ecosystems are equally – if not more – important in the cities of the developing world. Cities in sub-Saharan Africa are well known to be facing severe pressures. Nevertheless, despite the challenges of rapid population change, high levels of poverty and seemingly chaotic urban development processes, there are also tremendous opportunities. Realising the opportunities around urban green infrastructure and its benefits requires harnessing the inherent local knowledge and community innovation associated with a multitude of inter-connected urban social-ecological systems. Such systems are a powerful driving force shaping urban realities. Associated planning regimes are frequently lambasted as being either absent, weakly enforced, corrupt or wholly inappropriate. Much of this criticism is justified. However, it must also be recognised that decision-makers are frequently working in contexts which lack the scientific foundations through which their decision-making might be made more effective and complementary to bottom-up initiatives. The paucity of research into urban ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa and the lack of development of context-specific conceptual, theoretical and empirical foundations is a problem which must be addressed. Drawing on papers from a Special Issue centred on urban green infrastructure and urban ecosystem services in sub-Saharan Africa, we consider what concepts and frameworks are in use and what needs to be considered when framing future research. We also synthesise key messages from the Special Issue and draw together themes to help create a new research agenda for the international research community. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Africa; Ecosystem benefits; Frameworks; Green infrastructure; Review; Urban settlements","Decision making; Developing countries; Refuse disposal; Reviews; Urban growth; Africa; Environmental challenges; Frameworks; Green infrastructure; International researches; Scientific foundations; Social-ecological systems; Urban settlements; Ecosystems; bottom-up approach; conceptual framework; decision making; ecosystem service; greenspace; settlement pattern; settlement planning; urban area; urban development; Sub-Saharan Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053126157

However, it is unclear how much published empirical evidence exists to support these assumptions. We conducted a review of studies published between 1990 and May 2017 that examined urban biodiversity ecosystem service (BES) relationships. In total, we reviewed 317 publications and found biodiversity and UES metrics mentioned 944 times. Only 228 (24%) of the 944 mentions were empirically tested. Among these, 119 (52%) demonstrated a positive BES relationship. Our review showed that taxonomic metrics were used most often as proxies for biodiversity, with very little attention given to functional biodiversity metrics. Similarly, the role of particular species, including non-natives, and specific functional traits are understudied. Finally, we found a paucity of empirical evidence underpinning urban BES relationships. As urban planners increasingly incorporate UES delivery consideration to their decision-making, researchers need to address these substantial knowledge gaps to allow potential trade-offs and synergies between biodiversity conservation and the promotion of UES to be adequately accounted for. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029798725

The importance of these ecosystem services in urban environments, and the central role that cities play in the lives of people around the world, have motivated various attempts to quantify the value of ecosystem services provided by urban forests. This paper reviews existing research in the fields of urban forestry, economics, sociology, and health on the value of urban ecosystem services, with a focus on cultural services, a category of ecosystem services that is of key importance to human well-being but that has suffered from a lack of empirical research. The review identified 38 studies that examined the value of mixed vegetation, 31 studies that examined the value of trees, and 43 studies that examined the value of green spaces. Psychological health is the most-studied ecosystem service category, with most research in this area focusing on the services of mixed vegetation. Social health, community economic development, and tourism are the least-studied, with most research in these areas focusing on mixed vegetation and trees. Multiple metrics were used to quantify the value of urban greenery within each ecosystem service category but only 11 metrics were assigned a monetary value. Gaps in the literature that present strong opportunities for future research include: the value of urban forests for improving social health, equitable access to ecosystem services, the impact of urban forests on community economic development, and economic valuation and green exposure metrics. We hope that this review stimulates future research in the areas highlighted and that municipalities consider including evaluations of a broad range of ecosystem services during land use planning and budgeting processes. © 2017","Cities; Cultural ecosystem services; Review; Sustainability; Urban forests; Valuation; Well-being","air quality; cultural economy; economic development; ecosystem service; future prospect; greenspace; land use planning; literature review; public health; research work; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; urban ecosystem; urban forestry; urban planning; valuation; vegetation cover; North America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019633245

The outcomes of these projects with respect to the data they used, however, mainly consisted of two dimensions (2D). Studies that assess aspects of the third dimension (3D) of UES – such as height, volume and shadowing effects – were absent. The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the local ecological functions based on knowledge of three-dimensional UES. 298 articles were selected for in-depth critical analyses. The technical and computational approaches for extracting urban 3D structures and 3D structures of vegetation were the focus of the reviewed literature. Authors’ affiliations would be a better indicator for assessing the spatial distribution of articles. Uneven distribution of knowledge among countries is related to the technical and scientific advancement of countries. There was a shift in the sub-theme of reviewed publications discussing the concept of ecosystem services in the first few years, while later researchers’ interests moved towards UES and adaptation of cities to the changing climate. Further studies should progress in the development of both 3D data and results. Implementing 3D data and results helps to better understand the coupling of humans and their environs. It will be then a critically important step toward developing ecologically friendly cities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Review; Third dimension; Urban ecosystem services","Ecology; Reviews; Cities; Computational approach; Ecological functions; Spatial configuration; Third dimension; Two dimensions (2D); Urban ecosystem; Urban environments; Ecosystems; climate change; ecosystem service; literature review; spatial distribution; three-dimensional modeling; urban area; urban ecosystem; vegetation cover",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984846369

This was true in the nineteenth century and it seems to be the case again today, as a range of greening practices is co-Arising during a third, and perhaps final, period of global urbanization. Human health has been a recurring theme underlying the enduring aspiration to integrate nature with city. Using change over time as a conceptual frame, this paper offers a comparative assessment of municipal greening in the nineteenth and early twenty-first centuries, focusing on the potential implications upon, and the relationship between, such activity, urban design, and public health. In so doing, the narrative bridges theory, science, and practice, and dovetails with discourse on urban ecosystem services. Part one assesses prominent drivers and types of greening in nineteenth-century industrial cities, a pioneering period in this evolving narrative. Part two reviews contemporary literature on the human health benefits of urban green spaces, and draws comparisons to the Industrial Era. Part three explores potential links between contemporary greening practice and scholarship on related health benefits, wherein proximal greening emerges as a distinct form, and possible norm, for twenty-first-century urban design.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995532142

However, opportunities for creating new areas of green space within cities are often limited and tree planting initiatives may be constrained to kerbside locations. At this scale, the net impact of trees on human health and the local environment is less clear, and generalised approaches for evaluating their impact are not well developed. In this review, we use an urban ecosystems services framework to evaluate the direct, and locally-generated, ecosystems services and disservices provided by street trees. We focus our review on the services of major importance to human health and well-being which include 'climate regulation', 'air quality regulation' and 'aesthetics and cultural services'. These are themes that are commonly used to justify new street tree or street tree retention initiatives. We argue that current scientific understanding of the impact of street trees on human health and the urban environment has been limited by predominantly regional-scale reductionist approaches which consider vegetation generally and/or single out individual services or impacts without considering the wider synergistic impacts of street trees on urban ecosystems. This can lead planners and policymakers towards decision making based on single parameter optimisation strategies which may be problematic when a single intervention offers different outcomes and has multiple effects and potential trade-offs in different places. We suggest that a holistic approach is required to evaluate the services and disservices provided by street trees at different scales. We provide information to guide decision makers and planners in their attempts to evaluate the value of vegetation in their local setting. We show that by ensuring that the specific aim of the intervention, the scale of the desired biophysical effect and an awareness of a range of impacts guide the choice of i) tree species, ii) location and iii) density of tree placement, street trees can be an important tool for urban planners and designers in developing resilient and resourceful cities in an era of climatic change. © 2016 Salmond et al.","Climate; Ecosystems services; Health impacts; Street trees","volatile organic compound; climate change; decision making; ecosystem service; greenspace; health impact; health services; holistic approach; public health; sustainability; trade-off; tree planting; urban area; urban planning; vegetation dynamics; air quality; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric dispersion; city planning; climate; climate change; cultural factor; cultural value; environmental management; health status; human; microclimate; noise reduction; pollen; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Review; tree; urban area; vegetation; wellbeing; air pollution; city; city planning; environmental health; prevention and control; public health; tree; urban health; Air Pollution; Cities; City Planning; Environmental Health; Humans; Public Health; Trees; Urban Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995543025

Urban areas are human-environment systems that depend fundamentally on ecosystems, and thus require an understanding of the management of urban ecosystem services to ensure sustainable urban planning. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of urban ecosystems services research, which addresses the combined domain of ecosystem services and urban development. We examined emerging trends and gaps in how urban ecosystem services are conceptualized in peer-reviewed case study literature, including the geographical distribution of research, the development and use of the urban ecosystem services concept, and the involvement of stakeholders. We highlight six challenges aimed at strengthening the concept's potential to facilitate meaningful inter- and transdisciplinary work for ecosystem services research and planning. Achieving a cohesive conceptual approach in the research field will address (i) the need for more extensive spatial and contextual coverage, (ii) continual clarification of definitions, (iii) recognition of limited data transferability, (iv) more comprehensive stakeholder involvement, (v) more integrated research efforts, and (vi) translation of scientific findings into actionable knowledge, feeding information back into planning and management.

We present the results of an analysis of benefits of ecosystem services in urban areas. Empirical analyses included estimates of monetary benefits from urban ecosystem services based on data from 25 urban areas in the USA, Canada, and China. Our results show that investing in ecological infrastructure in cities, and the ecological restoration and rehabilitation of ecosystems such as rivers, lakes, and woodlands occurring in urban areas, may not only be ecologically and socially desirable, but also quite often, economically advantageous, even based on the most traditional economic approaches. © 2015 The Authors.",,"adaptation; climate change; ecological approach; economic development; ecosystem service; empirical analysis; environmental impact; infrastructural development; lake ecosystem; monetary policy; restoration ecology; river system; urban area; urban design; woodland; Canada; China; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934950069

Here we reviewed studies on ecosystem services in urban areas. Based on the concept and classification of urban ecosystem services, we summarized characteristics of urban ecosystem services, including the human domination, high demand of ecosystem services in urban areas, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of ecosystem services supply and demand in urban areas, multi-services of urban green infrastructures, the socio-economic dimension of ecosystem services supply and ecosystem disservices in urban areas. Among different urban ecosystem services, the regulating service and cultural service are particularly indispensable to benefit human health. We pointed out that tradeoffs among different types of ecosystem services mostly occur between supportive service and cultural service, as well as regulating service and cultural service. In particular, we emphasized the relationship between landscape design (i.e. green infrastructure) and ecosystem services supply. Finally, we discussed current gaps to link urban ecosystem services studies to landscape design and management and pointed out several directions for future research in urban ecosystem services. ©, 2015, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology.

Urban challenges such as air pollution, noise and heat can be moderated by urban green space (UGS), simultaneously providing multiple other services. However, available methods to quantify ES cannot typically deal with the high spatial and thematic resolution land cover data that are needed to better understand ES supply in the urban context. This study derives methods to quantify and map a bundle of six ES as supplied by UGS, using land cover data with high spatial and thematic resolution, and applies these to the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Land cover data comprise eight classes of UGS. Methods are derived from an evidence base on the importance of UGS types for the supply of each of the six ES that was built using literature review. The evidence base reveals that UGS types differ in their contribution to various ES, although the strength of the evidence varies. However, existing indicators for urban ES often do not discriminate between UGS types. To derive UGS-specific indicators, we combined methods and evidence from different research contexts (ES, non-ES, urban, non-urban). Rotterdam shows high spatial variation in the amount of UGS present, and accounting for this in ES supply reveals that ES bundles depend on UGS composition and configuration. While the contribution of UGS types to ES supply differed markedly with UGS type and ES considered, we demonstrate that synergies rather than trade-offs exist among the ES analysed. Synthesis and applications. Our findings underline the importance of a careful design of urban green space (UGS) in city planning for ecosystem services (ES) provision. Based on the latest insights on how different UGS provide ES, the methods presented in this study enable a more detailed quantification and mapping of the supply of ES in cities, allowing assessments of current supply of key urban ES and alternative urban designs. Such knowledge is indispensable in the quest for designing healthier and climate-resilient cities.

Objectives: We demonstrate the numerous opportunities for future research efforts that link metro nature, human health and well-being outcomes, and economic values. Methods: We reviewed the literature on urban nature-based health and well-being benefits. In this review, we provide a classification schematic and propose potential economic values associated with metro nature services. Discussion: Economic valuation of benefits derived from urban green systems has largely been undertaken in the fields of environmental and natural resource economics, but studies have not typically addressed health outcomes. Urban trees, parks, gardens, open spaces, and other nearby nature elements—collectively termed metro nature—generate many positive externalities that have been largely overlooked in urban economics and policy. Here, we present a range of health benefits, including benefit context and beneficiaries. Although the understanding of these benefits is not yet consistently expressed, and although it is likely that attempts to link urban ecosystem services and economic values will not include all expressions of cultural or social value, the development of new interdisciplinary approaches that integrate environmental health and economic disciplines are greatly needed. Conclusions: Metro nature provides diverse and substantial benefits to human populations in cities. In this review, we begin to address the need for development of valuation methodologies and new approaches to understanding the potential economic outcomes of these benefits. © 2015, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

However, recent work by urban ecologists and urban designers has more closely examined and appreciated the opportunities associated with integrating natural and built infrastructures. Nevertheless, a perception remains in the literature on ecosystem services that technology may easily and irreversibly substitute for services previously obtained from ecosystems, especially when the superiority of the engineered system motivated replacement in the first place. We emphasize that the expected tradeoff between natural and manufactured capital is false. Rather, as argued in other contexts, the adoption of new technologies is complementary to ecosystem management. The complementarity of ecosystem services and technology is illustrated with a case study in Barcelona, Spain where the installation of sophisticated water treatment technology increased the value of the ecosystem services found there. Interestingly, the complementarity between natural and built infrastructures may remain even for the very ecosystems that are affected by the technological change. This finding suggests that we can expect the value of ecosystem services to co-evolve with new technologies. Technological innovation can generate new opportunities to harness value from ecosystems, and the engineered structures found in cities may generate more reliance on ecosystem processes, not less. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","Desalination; Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Natural capital; Substitution; Technology; Urban ecosystems; Urban planning; Water treatment","Desalination; Refuse disposal; Substitution reactions; Technology; Urban planning; Water treatment; Ecosystem service values; Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Natural capital; Technological innovation; Urban ecosystem; Value of ecosystem services; Water treatment technologies; Ecosystems; desalination; ecosystem service; infrastructure; innovation; natural capital; sustainable development; technological change; trade-off; urban ecosystem; urban planning; water treatment; city; ecosystem; engineering; environmental management; review; Spain; technology; urban area; water treatment; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Harness; Cities; Ecosystem; Engineering; Spain; Technology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902279365

This paper gives a systematic overview of the relationship, in terms of so-called 'ecosystem services', between urban green infrastructure and the indoor environment through a literature review in different disciplines. Urban green infrastructure (mainly trees, green walls and roofs) was found to contribute, both positively and negatively, to the indoor environment via the influence on the climate, energy use, air quality, sonic environment and aesthetic quality. Four main factors that influence these effects were identified, being vegetation characteristics, building characteristics (including layout and geometry), and geographical conditions. Although the reviewed papers have investigated the different ecosystem services on a wide range of space and time scales, the performance of urban green on the meso- and macro climate has received less attention than on the micro scale. Also direct effects of urban green infrastructure on indoor air quality and sonic environment were rarely studied. Another finding is that, whereas the modelling approach on climate regulation has been widely adopted by researchers throughout the world, empirical studies have mainly been performed in the USA. We also analysed the data found on economic implications. The economic effects of adjoining vegetation and green roofs on climate regulation provided energy savings of up to almost $250/tree/year, while the air quality regulation was valued between $0.12 and $0.6/m2 tree cover/year. Maximum monetary values attributed to noise regulation and aesthetic appreciation of urban green were $20 - $25/person/year, respectively. Of course these values are extremely time- and context-dependent but do give an indication of the potential economic effects of investing in urban green infrastructure. Based on this review, we conclude that new methods, measurement instruments and field experiments are needed to improve empirically supported correlations and develop concrete recommendations for urban planning and design. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Green infrastructure; Human comfort; Indoor environment; Literature review; Urban ecosystem services; Vegetation","Air quality; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Forestry; Indoor air pollution; Roofs; Vegetation; Green infrastructure; Human comforts; Indoor environment; Literature reviews; Urban ecosystem; Ecosystems; air quality; economic impact; ecosystem service; greenspace; literature review; urban area; urban planning; Air Pollution; Air Quality; Ecosystems; Forestry; Plants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898677078

Multifunctional landscapes where ecosystem service provisions are 'designed-in' can help 'transition' cities to more sustainable environments which are more resilient to changing future conditions. With benefits ranging from the supply of water, habitat and energy to pollutant removal, amenity and opportunities for recreation, urban water bodies can provide a focal point for reconnecting humans and nature in otherwise densely built-up areas. Managing water within urban spaces is an essential infrastructure requirement but has historically been undertaken in isolation from other urban functions and spatial requirements. Increasingly, because of the limits of space and need to respond to new drivers (e.g. mitigation of diffuse pollution), more sustainable approaches to urban water management are being applied which can have multiple functions and benefits. This paper presents a review of ecosystem services associated with water, particularly those in urban environments, and uses the emerging language of ecosystem services to provide a framework for discussion. The range of supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services associated with differing types of urban water bodies are identified. A matrix is then used to evaluate the results of a series of social, ecological and physical science studies co-located on a single stretch of a restored urban river. Findings identify the benefits of, but also barriers to, the implementation of a transdisciplinary research approach. For many, transdisciplinary research still appears to be on the edge of scientific respectability. In order to approach this challenge, it is imperative that we bring together discipline specific expertise to address fundamental and applied problems in a holistic way. The ecosystem services approach offers an exciting mechanism to support researchers in tackling research questions that require thinking beyond traditional scientific boundaries. The opportunity to fully exploit this approach to collaborative working should not be lost. © The Author(s) 2011.","Millennium Ecosystem Assessment; multifunctional landscapes; urban ecosystem services; water","ecosystem service; landscape; public space; sustainable development; urban area; urban ecosystem; water management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053618339
